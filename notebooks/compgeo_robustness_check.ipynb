      "abstract AbstractGas injection is a proven economical process that significantly increases oil and condensate recovery from hydrocarbon reservoirs. Relative permeability is an important parameter in modeling, simulation, and evaluation of gas injection. In this study, new empirical-mathematical models are developed to predict the relative permeability of gas-oil systems in different rock and fluid systems. The Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) technique is employed to develop relative permeability equations. The smart correlations presented in this work require capillary number, interfacial tension, API, gas molecular weight, and viscosity ratio as extra input variables to improve its precision and accuracy. The significance of each parameter is evaluated by statistical approach and Taguchi experimental design. The new models are evaluated by experimental data extracted from literature and validated by extensive error analysis. Additionally, laboratory tests were performed for determining gas-oil relative permeability which were used to check the accuracy of new developed correlations. In relative permeability curves for different gas flow rates, the coupling effect becomes strong and, in competition with the inertia effect, causes changes in the relative permeability with flow rate. The comparison of the experimental results of this study with the new proposed correlation resulted in a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0796 for gas relative permeability and 0.0564 for oil relative permeability. The results strongly admit the MGGP approach and high accuracy of developed mathematical correlations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDeep learning techniques are increasingly being considered for geological applications where—much like in computer vision—the challenges are characterized by high-dimensional spatial data dominated by multipoint statistics. In particular, a novel technique called generative adversarial networks has been recently studied for geological parametrization and synthesis, obtaining very impressive results that are at least qualitatively competitive with previous methods. The method obtains a neural network parametrization of the geology—so-called a generator—that is capable of reproducing very complex geological patterns with dimensionality reduction of several orders of magnitude. Subsequent works have addressed the conditioning task, i.e., using the generator to generate realizations honoring spatial observations (hard data). The current approaches, however, do not provide a parametrization of the conditional generation process. In this work, we propose a method to obtain a parametrization for direct generation of conditional realizations. The main idea is to simply extend the existing generator network by stacking a second inference network that learns to perform the conditioning. This inference network is a neural network trained to sample a posterior distribution derived using a Bayesian formulation of the conditioning task. The resulting extended neural network thus provides the conditional parametrization. Our method is assessed on a benchmark image of binary channelized subsurface, obtaining very promising results for a wide variety of conditioning configurations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA single-objective well placement problem is one of the classical optimization problems in oilfield development and has been studied for many years, by researchers worldwide. However, the necessity to face practical applications and handle insufficient data in a single-objective optimization leads to the introduction of a multi-objective optimization framework, which consequently allows an engineer to manage more information. In this study, for the very first time, a multi-objective well placement optimization framework, based on a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is utilized with a similarity-based mating scheme. To represent the power of this mating procedure, it is compared with two conventional mating selection methods (tournament and roulette wheel selection). In this novel framework, the net present value (NPV) and the recovery factor are considered to be the objective functions while the well coordinates, well types, horizontal section length, orientation, and water injection rate are all assumed as the problem variables. Compared to the tournament and roulette wheel selection methods, the convergence speed analysis of this method indicates a substantial reduction in time, with the number of iterations reduced by 26 and 20%, respectively. Among the mating technique, which is implemented in this work, the final Pareto front, presented in this similarity-based selection method, has more members in the same solution range. Having more individuals in the final Pareto front provides more scenarios for decision makers, which helps them in choosing an optimal scenario based on the limitations and interests of a company.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe apply an accurate parallel stabilised finite element method to solve for Navier-Stokes equations directly on a binarised three-dimensional rock image, obtained by micro-CT imaging. The proposed algorithm has several advantages. First, the linear equal-order finite element space for velocity and pressure is ideal for presenting the pixel images. Second, the algorithm is fully explicit and versatile for describing complex boundary conditions. Third, the fully explicit matrix–free finite element implementation is ideal for parallelism on high-performance computers, similar to lattice Boltzmann. In the last, the memory usage is low compared with lattice Boltzmann or implicit finite volume. We compute the permeability of a range of rock images. The stabilisation parameter may affect the velocity, and an optimal parameter is chosen from the numerical tests. The steady state results are comparable with lattice Boltzmann method and implicit finite volume. The transient behaviour of pseudo-compressible stabilised finite element and lattice Boltzmann method is very similar. Our analysis shows that the stabilised finite element is an accurate and efficient method with low memory cost for the image- based simulations of flow in the pore scale up to 1 billion voxels on 128-GB ram workstation and on distributed clusters.\n",

Methods Eng. 60(2):527–548 2004) and subsequently studied by Gervais and her coauthors for the simulation of large-scale transport processes of sediments, subject to an erosion constraint. Two major novelties are considered: (i) the diffusion law relating the flux of sediments and the slope of the topography is now nonlinear and involves a p-Laplacian with p > 2 in order for landscape evolutions to be more realistic; (ii) the sediment transport is now intertwined with the water flows due to lakes and rivers via a direct coupling at the continuous PDE level, which avoids empirical algorithms at the discrete level such as MFD (multiple flow directions) at the price of additional p-Laplacians. Aimed at enriching the capabilities of IFPEN’s simulator, these sophistications entail the construction of a new finite volume scheme, the details of which are supplied. The physical model is validated through several test cases. Finally, a further extension of the model to the case of multiple lithologies is presented, along with numerical results.\n",

Our workflow is based on the Bayesian evidential learning approach and exploits learning the direct relation between seismic data and reservoir properties to efficiently estimate reservoir properties. The theoretical framework we develop allows incorporation of non-linear statistical models for seismic estimation problems. Uncertainty quantification is performed with approximate Bayesian computation. With the help of a synthetic example of estimation of reservoir net-to-gross and average fluid saturations in sub-resolution thin sand reservoir, several nuances are foregrounded regarding the applicability of unsupervised and supervised learning methods for seismic estimation problems. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by estimating posterior uncertainty of reservoir net-to-gross in sub-resolution thin sand reservoir from an offshore delta dataset using 3D pre-stack seismic data.\n",

      "abstract AbstractResistivity and acoustic logs are widely used to estimate gas hydrate saturation in various sedimentary systems using one of the two popular methods ((1) acoustic velocity and (2) electrical resistivity), but the limitations of these two methods are often overlooked, which include (i) well-specific calibration of empirical exponents in the electrical resistivity method, (ii) assumption of known pore morphology for gas hydrates in the acoustic velocity method, and (iii) presence of unknown mineralogy and bulk modulus terms in the acoustic velocity method. NMR-density porosity-derived gas hydrate saturation based on the analysis of the transverse magnetization relaxation time (T2) is considered the most precise method, but acquisition of NMR-based logs is limited at relatively recent drilled sites; additionally, its use in conventional oil and gas reservoirs is not that common due to higher cost and operational deployment limitations associated with acquiring NMR well-logs. This study proposes a new method that predicts gas hydrate saturation (Sh) for any well using porosity, bulk density, and compressional wave (P wave) velocity well-logs with neural network (or stochastic gradient descent regression) without any well-specific calibration and/or other aforementioned shortcomings of the existing methods. The method is developed by examining the underlying dependency between Sh and different combinations of well-logs, chosen from 6 routine logs, with 12 different machine learning (ML) algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed method in predicting Sh is ~ 84%, which is better than the accuracy of seismic and electrical resistivity methods (≤ 75%) per the results reported by three different studies. The robustness of the method in the specific case of permafrost-associated gas hydrates is demonstrated with well-log data from two wells drilled on the Alaska North Slope.\n",

The remarkable characteristic of the proposed model is its ability to simulate the generation of fractures and the mineral reactions within the generated fractures as well as the subsequent changes in permeability. The proposed model was applied to predictions of the long-term changes in the permeability of rock located near high-level radioactive waste within a geological repository. The predicted results revealed that fractures were generated near the disposal cavity and that the permeability of the damaged zone increased significantly more than that of the intact rock during the excavation, while the permeability in almost the entire damaged zone decreased by about one order of magnitude due to pressure solution at the contacting asperities within the rock fractures after setting virtual radioactive waste into the disposal cavity. Overall, it was clarified that the proposed model is capable of calculating the permeability evolution of rock through fracture generation and subsequent sealing due to mineral reactions at the actual field scale. Thus, the potential for using the proposed model to examine the long-term performance of natural barriers for delaying the transport of radionuclides has been shown.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe consider mechanics of composite materials in which thin inclusions are modeled by lower-dimensional manifolds. By successively applying the dimensional reduction to junctions and intersections within the material, a geometry of hierarchically connected manifolds is formed which we refer to as mixed-dimensional. The governing equations with respect to linear elasticity are then defined on this mixed-dimensional geometry. The resulting system of partial differential equations is also referred to as mixed-dimensional, since functions defined on domains of multiple dimensionalities are considered in a fully coupled manner. With the use of a semi-discrete differential operator, we obtain the variational formulation of this system in terms of both displacements and stresses. The system is then analyzed and shown to be well-posed with respect to appropriately weighted norms. Numerical discretization schemes are proposed using well-known mixed finite elements in all dimensions. The schemes conserve linear momentum locally while relaxing the symmetry condition on the stress tensor. Stability and convergence are shown using a priori error estimates and confirmed numerically.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe general field development optimization problem is complex due to the potentially large number of controls of mixed type and discontinuities in the objective function related to varying numbers and types of wells being placed in a discretized grid. This may make the problem challenging or even unsuitable for certain types of optimization methods that rely on, e.g., the availability of (adjoint) gradients. It is not yet clear which alternative approaches will be most useful. Here we investigate the application of stochastic gradient-based optimization techniques to field development optimization. Since their initial application to large-scale well rate and pressure control problems, such techniques have been shown to produce useful results of practical value also for other types of reservoir optimization problems such vertical well placement, well drilling scheduling, and water-alternating-gas strategy optimization. Here we introduce an efficient parameterization for well trajectory optimization and discuss a simple way to handle the number of wells that is placed. The full field development problem is split into subproblems that are addressed sequentially. The sequential workflow is applied to the Olympus benchmark model which represents a complex green field development optimization challenge. Initial experiments show that the proposed approach based on stochastic gradient methods is able to find much improved development strategies, as defined by the number and trajectories of wells, a platform location and a drilling sequence, at relatively low computational cost. We additionally identify a number of possible improvements to the applied workflow that are expected to make it applicable to other field cases of intermediate complexity.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe identification of micropore systems in carbonate rocks is an important task of image processing because of the high impact these systems cause on fluid flow. Currently, one of the main tools used to characterize rock samples is computed tomography (CT). Such micro information poses the challenge associated with the limitation of the CT’s resolution. Therefore, we propose an alternative method of inserting the micropore features of μ CT to lower resolution images, but with higher coverage. We can perform this by a novel application of Style Transfer that can insert the heterogeneity pattern of high-resolution (HR) images (CT of 7 and 40 μm resolution) into low-resolution (LR) images (CT of 90 μm resolution), downscaling the image through a super-resolution method. This technique uses the power of VGG19, a convolutional neural network that won the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2014, as a texture extractor. We applied this novel technique to condensed shell rocks, called coquinas, from the Itapema Formation, Santos Basin offshore Brazil. The porosity of the LR image, with initial average value of 11%, resulted in an average porosity of 12% (40 μm res.) and 13% (7 μm res.) after downscaling. This is closer to the porosity range of the coquina (13% to 32%, with a mean of 21%) and an increase in the porosity of 6% and 19% in average, respectively. Despite this, the connectivity of the original LR CT was of 3% on average and, in the simulated HR CT, the connectivity was of 5% (40 μm res.) and 6% (7 μm res.). In addition, in such examples, this method inserted connectivity in directions that were null in low-resolution images before the style transfer. Hence, the results demonstrated that the Style Transfer offers an alternative for downscaling CT images by inserting the texture from high-resolution images.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe identification of rock thin sections plays a pivotal role in geological exploration, as it provides critical insights into the fundamental properties and composition of rocks. However, the accurate identification of mineral particles presents significant challenges due to three primary factors: the inherent imbalance in data distribution, misclassification caused by feature similarity, and substantial feature variations observed under different cross-polarized angles. These complexities render conventional deep-learning models with single-structure architectures inadequate for precise mineral particle identification. Therefore, this study proposes a novel rock thin section image classification methodology that combines a Multi-Scale Channel Enhanced Transformer (MSCET) with a Sequence Consistency Optimization (SCO) strategy. This integrated approach is designed to effectively extract distinctive features of mineral particles while fully exploiting the influence of polarization angle variations. The MSCET architecture synergistically combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), and Transformer mechanisms to enhance the network’s feature representation capabilities. Specifically, it employs distinct convolutional operations to extract both coarse- and fine-grained features of mineral particles. The SENet and Transformer structures are then utilized to aggregate global information across both channel and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce the SCO strategy to refine low-confidence predictions, thereby mitigating the impact of feature variations in multi-angle cross-polarized images. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, achieving a classification accuracy of 92.35% on the test set. The method also shows significant improvements in key performance metrics, including recall, precision, and F1 score, substantiating its potential for robust rock thin section identification in geological applications.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPermeability is a crucial parameter in geology and petroleum engineering. Traditional methods for measuring the permeability of rocks primarily rely on physical experiments, which can easily damage the integrity of rocks, thus affecting subsequent analyses. Current approaches are mainly based on digital rock images using direct numerical simulation methods or deep learning methods to obtain permeability. Although these methods avoid destroying rocks, there are challenges of high computational complexity and capturing complex features on the microstructure for different rocks. To address these challenges, we design a novel network for the lightweight and efficient prediction of permeability in 3D porous media. We made our novel design in two steps: First, to reduce the computational burden, we introduced three-dimensional depthwise separable convolution into the network. Second, to enhance the capture of micro-features in digital rock, we incorporate an efficient multi-scale attention mechanism into the network. Finally, we propose the 3D-EmaSepNet. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D-EmaSepNet performs well on different rock types, such as sandstones and carbonates. Specifically, compared to traditional three-dimensional convolution, the computational cost of 3D-EmaSepNet using three-dimensional depthwise separable convolution is reduced by a factor of 9.6. Our 3D-EmaSepNet achieves coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 94.57% and mean squared error (MSE) loss of 0.10 on the validation dataset for sandstone, while reaching R2 score of 93.91% and MSE loss of 0.31 on the validation dataset for carbonate. These results show the potential of 3D-EmaSepNet for practical applications in geology, petroleum engineering, and other fields.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIdentifying rock properties at the pore scale plays a crucial role in understanding larger-scale properties. For this purpose, the digital rock physics technique is used to model rock images at the pore scale. Achieving high-resolution (HR) images with a large field of view (FoV) is essential for pore-scale modeling of heterogeneous rock samples, which presents significant challenges due to their complex structures. However, because of the trade-off between resolution and FoV, it is not possible to acquire large HR images. Multi-scale image reconstruction methods enable modeling images at different resolutions and FoVs. Despite various approaches being introduced, a common limitation is the high computational cost. In this study, a novel approach based on Octree structures is introduced to minimize computational cost while maintaining accuracy. A Berea sandstone (BS) and an Edward Brown Carbonate (EBC) sample were scanned at both HR and low resolution (LR) using X-ray microtomography. Our method involves splitting the unresolved porosity in rock images into smaller sections of unresolved templates using the watershed algorithm and considering the optimized parameters. We then applied a cross-correlation based simulation technique to find the best match of each unresolved template. The novelty of our approach lies in the use of an Octree structure to perform calculations on LR images, significantly reducing computation time and memory consumption due to the fewer number of pixels in Octree LR structures. The accuracy of the images thus reconstructed using our approach was compared with those from previous methods by evaluating geometric properties and single- and two-phase flow properties. The results were promising, demonstrating that our approach achieved a permeability close to the real value, while the previous method had an error of approximately 4% for both BS and EBC rocks. More importantly, our approach was approximately three times faster and reduced memory usage by 20 to 130 times. The findings of this study facilitate dual- or multi-scale modeling and evaluate heterogeneous rock images at a significantly lower computational cost. In particular, for heterogeneous rocks, where multi-scale image reconstruction demands substantial memory and runtime, the use of the Octree technique enables accurate reconstruction with lower computational cost.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this article, we present a novel data assimilation strategy in pore-scale imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic processes in the context of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray \\(\\mu \\)CT) process, which induces discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical \\(\\mu \\)CT images, by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow. The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE models, with a latent concentration field, and dynamical \\(\\mu \\)CT observations. The data assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating successively additional PDE constraints and suitable formulation of the heterogeneous diffusion differential operator leading to enhanced computational efficiency. We provide a robust and unbiased uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian Inference in 1D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic \\(\\mu \\)CT images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and dimensionless numbers. We eventually apply this framework to a more realistic 2D+Time data assimilation problem involving heterogeneous porosity levels and synthetic \\(\\mu \\)CT dynamical observations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn the process of harnessing geothermal energy, the enduring effects of thermal cycling on granite within the geothermal reservoir led to alterations in rock permeability. This, in turn, directly impacts the efficiency of thermal energy extraction. Hence, delving into the micro-permeability dynamics of granite is imperative to understand the characteristics of prevalent fractures. Employing micro-CT technology, we meticulously extract and analyze the pores of granite samples, unveiling the distribution patterns of pores and micro-permeability variations under successive thermal cycles. The resultant three-dimensional pore model vividly showcases the evolving pore structures during both heating and cooling cycles. Notably, the distribution curve of granite pore volume adheres to a chi-square distribution. Through the utilization of pore volume distribution curves, we categorize rock pores into four distinct types: micropores, mesopores, macropores, and fractures. Both quantitatively and visually, micropores and mesopores predominate, while a fraction of pores gradually transitions into sizable fractures. By employing suitable representative elements to construct the flow field within the large pore model and subsequently calculating permeability, we observe a positive correlation between porosity, permeability, and cyclic temperature-induced damage. Notably, the estimated permeability closely aligns with the measured values, exhibiting an acceptable margin of error. Furthermore, under the influence of thermal cycle-induced damage, the flow simulation demonstrates a noticeable increase in the number of flow lines, consequently resulting in enhanced permeability. This effectively validates the accuracy of the flow simulation based on micro-CT results.\n",

      "abstract AbstractVarious types of geophysical measurements have been made available to illuminate different characteristics of subsurface reservoir formations. It becomes crucial to both efficiently and effectively utilize the information contained in these measurements for enhanced reservoir characterization and more informative decision-making support. To address the problem, image-oriented history matching approaches were proposed, which have shown promising results in efficiently assimilating multiple types of geophysical measurements. Relying on the interpretability of geophysical measurements, image-oriented strategies seek to match the extracted features or patterns (e.g., water front positions from the inverted saturation field) instead of the original data in the model update step. Consequently, the quality of the extracted features directly impacts the performance of these methods. However, extracting reliable features from related geophysical data is not straightforward. It requires not only in-depth domain knowledge but also appropriate image processing techniques. This study explores the use of deep learning (DL) based image segmentation techniques as an alternative to assist the feature extraction for an image-oriented ensemble-based history matching workflow. Accounting for the special characteristics of the considered application, a fast unsupervised DL segmentation model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used together with an image denoising algorithm. The developed workflow separates the history matching of geophysical data into two sequential steps. It starts with a (joint) geophysical inversion step for saturation mapping, followed by a featured-oriented assimilation step to match the inverted saturation field, in which water front positions are extracted using the DL-based segmentation model. We test the proposed workflow on a synthetic reservoir model to history match electromagnetic (EM) and seismic data, which illustrates its promising performance in extracting relevant information from the data for efficient history matching.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMulti-frequency dielectric scanning logging is an advanced method that plays a critical role in evaluating unconventional oil and gas reserves and residual oil distribution. This method provides higher accuracy compared to conventional logging and can obtain essential formation parameters such as formation water salinity, pore textural index, and dispersive phase volume fraction. Despite its advantages, the inversion of permittivity and conductivity measurements at multiple frequencies into formation properties remains a \"black box\" problem. This challenge makes it challenging to understand specific implementation methods and inversion techniques without purchasing expensive software and hardware from oil field service companies. To address this issue, this work proposes a publicly available and advanced intelligent optimization algorithm. Our approach reduces calculation complexity and achieves high accuracy in evaluating petrophysical properties, including shaly sand reservoirs, without relying on costly software services from oil field companies. Our method offers distinct advantages over traditional approaches, such as the ability to derive formation properties from dielectric logging information with confidence, without specialized equipment or software from commercial providers. Additionally, the open-source code is readily available in various programming languages, including Python, R, and Matlab, making our approach accessible and easy to implement.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEvaluating and checking subsurface models is essential before their use to support optimum subsurface development decision making. Conventional geostatistical modeling workflows (e.g., two-point variogram-based geostatistics and multiple-point statistics) may fail to reproduce complex realistic geological patterns (e.g., channels), or be constrained by the limited training images and computational cost. Deep learning, specifically generative adversarial network (GAN), has been applied for subsurface modeling due to its ability to reproduce spatial and geological patterns, but may fail to reproduce commonly observed nonstationary subsurface patterns and often rely on many training images with the inability to explore realizations around specific geological scenarios. We propose an enhanced model checking workflow demonstrated by evaluating the performance of single image GAN (SinGAN)-based 2D image realizations for the case of channelized subsurface reservoirs to support robust uncertainty around geological scenarios. The SinGAN is able to generate nonstationary realizations from a single training image. Our minimum acceptance criteria expand on the work of Leuangthong, Boisvert, and others tailored to the nonstationary, single training image approach of SinGAN by evaluating the facies proportion, spatial continuity, and multiple-point statistics through histogram, semivariogram, and n-point histogram, along with evaluating the nonstationarity reproduction through multiple distribution checks ranging from local scale pixel distribution to multiscale local distribution. Additionally, our workflow incorporates reduced-dimensionality analysis through self-attention, providing a flexible approach for deep learning-based enhanced model realization to single training image comparison. With our proposed workflows, the robust application of SinGAN is possible to explore uncertainty around geological scenarios.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMultiple-point geostatistics has recently attracted significant attention for characterization of environmental variables. Such methods proceed by searching a large database of patterns obtained from a training image to find a match for a given data-event. The template-matching phase is usually the most time-consuming part of a MPS method. Linear transformations like discrete cosine transform or wavelet transform are capable of representing the image patches with a few nonzero coefficients. This sparsifying capability can be employed to speed up the template-matching problem up to hundreds of times by multiplying only nonzero coefficients. This method is only applicable to rectangular data-events because it is impossible to represent an odd-shaped data-event in a transformation domain. In this paper, the method is applied to speed up the image quilting (IQ) method. The experiments show that the proposed method is capable of accelerating the IQ method tens of times without sensible degradation in simulation results. The method has the potential to be employed for accelerating optimization-based and raster-scan patch-based MPS algorithms.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThree sets of synthetic images were created from two original datasets. A suite exhibiting greyscale contrast was produced from an 8.96-μm voxel size 3D X-ray microscopy image of a sandstone rock and a two suites (one showing greyscale contrast and one showing both greyscale and textural contrast) were produced from a 5 × 5 × 5 nm voxel size FIB-SEM image of a shale rock. The performance of three image segmentation algorithms (global multi-Otsu thresholding, seeded watershed region growing, and machine learning-based multivariant classification) was then assessed by their ability to recover their respective original segmented 3D images. While all algorithms performed well at low noise levels, machine learning-based classification proved significantly more noise tolerant than either of the traditional algorithms. It was also able to segment the non-greyscale (textural based) contrast, something the traditional completely failed to do, with voxel misclassification rates for the traditional techniques above 50% at a 0 noise level within the textural contrast regions. Machine learning-based classification, in contrast, achieved misclassification rates of less than 5% in the same regions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSubsurface earth models (referred as geomodels) are crucial for characterizing complex subsurface systems. Multiple-point statistics is commonly used to generate geomodels. In this paper, a deep-learning-based generative method is developed as an alternative to traditional geomodel generation procedure. The generative method comprises two deep-learning models, namely hierarchical vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE-2) and PixelSNAIL autoregressive model. Based on the principle of neural discrete representation learning, the VQ-VAE-2 learns to massively compress the geomodels to extract the low-dimensional, discrete latent representation corresponding to each geomodel. Following that, PixelSNAIL uses deep autoregressive network to learn the prior distribution of the latent codes. For the purpose of geomodel generation, PixelSNAIL samples from the newly learnt prior distribution of latent codes, and then the decoder of the VQ-VAE-2 converts the newly sampled latent code to a newly constructed geomodel. PixelSNAIL can be used for unconditional or conditional geomodel generation. In unconditional generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of geomodels without any constraint. On the other hand, in the conditional geomodel generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of geomodels similar to a user-defined source image, which ultimately facilitates the control and manipulation of the generated geomodels. To better construct the fluvial channels in the geomodels, perceptual loss is implemented in the VQ-VAE-2 model instead of the traditional ‘mean squared error’ loss. At a specific compression ratio, the quality of multi-attribute geomodel generation is better than that of single-attribute geomodel generation.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCurrent micro-CT image resolution is limited to 1–2 microns. A recent study has identified that at least 10 image voxels are needed to resolve pore throats, which limits the applicability of direct simulations using the digital rock (DR) technology to medium-to-coarse–grained rocks (i.e., rocks with permeability > 100 mD). On the other hand, 2D high-resolution colored images such as the ones obtained from transmitted light microscopy delivers a much higher resolution (approximately 0.6 microns). However, reliable and efficient workflows to jointly utilize full-size 2D images, measured 3D core-plug permeabilities, and 2D direct pore-scale ow simulations on 2D images within a predictive framework for permeability estimation are lacking. In order to close this gap, we have developed a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithm for the direct prediction of permeability from 2D images. We take advantage of the computing graphics processing units (GPUs) in our implementation of this algorithm. The trained DL model predicts properties accurately within seconds, and therefore, provide a significant speeding up simulation workflow. A real-life dataset is used to demonstrate the applicability and versatility of the proposed method.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAn image-based effective medium approximation (EMA) is developed so as to permit very fast transport properties evaluations of 3D porous media. From an image-based porous network (IBPN) built upon digital image processing of 3D binary images, we focus on throat’s local geometrical properties at the pore scale, for being the most sensible structural units which build up the local pressure. This approach is a 3D image–based extension of the critical point approach proposed in 2D fractures. We show, from analyzing various core rock samples available in the literature, that the asymptotic assumptions associated with the preeminence of critical points in throats are indeed geometrically relevant. We then describe how the image-based EMA evaluated from the conductances computed from the discrete IBPN can be reliably evaluated. The proposed method is evaluated upon the estimation of core sample permeability from binarized image obtained using X-ray tomography. Since it combines digital image treatments with statistical data post-processing without the need of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computation, it is extremely cost efficient. The results are compared with a micro-scale Stokes flow computation in various rock samples. The sensitivity to the pore discretization also is discussed and illustrated.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAs a serious meteorological natural disaster, windstorm has caused great harm to people’s lives and property. The tracking and trending of the wind storm, as well as the spatio-temporal process changes of its key features, such as wind eye, eye-wall, and wind circle, have long been the researchers’ focuses. The use of visualization tools to help meteorologists analyze and understand the spatio-temporal features and their process of storms quickly and intuitively is of far-reaching significance to the prediction of storm activities and the engagement in other work. Yet, it is difficult to have a quick understanding of the wind features by means of current visualization methods. Generally, wind field data at a certain time in a specific area are visualized directly, but have difficulties in discovering and understanding the wind features. Besides, the changes in the wind field are mostly presented at a discrete time, which can not show continuous changes or the whole life cycle of wind features. To provide a solution to these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal visualization method of wind features from wind field data, which converts unified process-oriented representation to visualization with the help of visual coding. Then, a process-oriented spatio-temporal visualization method is provided to express the spatio-temporal continuous change process. Based on the data from Typhoon Jelawat, an experiment is designed to analyze the expression of spatio-temporal process of wind features, such as wind eye, wind circle, and so on. By evaluating the user feedbacks for the proposed method, it can be known that compared to other wind visualization tools, this method boasts unique advantages in recognizing wind features and describing their spatio-temporal process evolution over a period of time continuously.\n",

      "abstract AbstractComputationally efficient updating of reservoir models with new production data has received considerable attention recently. In this paper however, we focus on the challenges of updating reservoir models prior to production, in particular when new exploration wells are drilled. At this stage, uncertainty in the depositional model is highly impactful in terms of risk and decision making. Mathematically, such uncertainty is often decomposed into uncertainty of lithological trends in facies proportions which is typically informed by seismic data, and sub-seismic variability often modeled geostatistically by means of training images. While uncertainty in the training image has received considerable attention, uncertainty in the trend/facies proportion receives little to no consideration. In many practical applications, with either poor geophysical data or little well information, the trend is often as uncertain as the training image, yet is often fixed, leading to unrealistic uncertainty models. The problem is addressed through a hierarchical model of probability. Total model uncertainty is divided into first uncertainty in the training image, then uncertainty in the trend given the uncertain training image. Our methodology relies on an efficient Bayesian updating of these model parameters (trend and training image) by modeling forward-simulated well facies profiles in low-dimensional metric space. We apply this methodology to a real field case study involving wells drilled sequentially in the subsurface, where as more data becomes available, uncertainty in both training image and trend require updating to improve characterization of the facies.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique has been widely used to reservoir evaluation and core analysis in oil industry. Rapid and stable inversion of NMR data is very important for NMR logging application. A rapid data compression method with high compression ratio can effectively improve the inversion speed of NMR data. This paper compared and analyzed the window averaging (WA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) methods for NMR data compression. The numerical results show that the WA method has the features of low compression ratio, low computational complexity, and less time-consuming; the SVD method has the features of high compression ratio, large amount of calculation, and more time-consuming. Combining the advantages of these two compression methods, this paper proposed a novel compression method which had achieved good application effects in NMR data compression. The novel method can not only ensure the high compression ratio, but also effectively reduces the time-consuming and possesses more prominent advantages in multi-dimensional NMR data compression.\n",

      "abstract AbstractLand cover classification is one of the most important applications of POLSAR images. In this paper, a hybrid biogeography-based optimization support vector machine (HBBOSVM) has been introduced to classify POLSAR images of RADARSAT 2 in band C acquired from San Francisco, USA. The main purpose of this classification is to minimize the number of features and maximize classification accuracy. The proposed method consists of three main steps: preprocessing, feature selection and classification. As preprocessing, radiometric calibration, speckle reduction and feature extraction have been performed. In the proposed HBBO, the combination of onlooker bee of artificial bee colony (ABC) and migration operator of biogeography-based optimization has been applied in order to optimal feature selection. Then, SVM has been used to classify the pixels into specific labels of land-covers. The ground truth samples have been generated by google earth image, Pauli RGB image, high resolution image and national land cover database (NLCD 2006). The performance of HBBOSVM has been compared with BBOSVM, ABCSVM, particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSOSVM) and the results of previous studies. In addition, the performance of HBBO is evaluated upon 20 well-known benchmark problems. According to the obtained results, the overall accuracy and average accuracy of HBBOSVM are 96.01% and 93.37% respectively which is the best result in comparison with other results. The HBBOSVM has better performance than other algorithms in terms of overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, average accuracy, convergence trend, and stability. In addition, the HBBO can be considered as a successful meta-heuristic for benchmark problems. This paper displays that the combined approach of optimization and machine learning methods provides powerful results.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMultiphase flow in porous media often occurs with the formation and coalescence of fluid ganglia. Accurate predictions of such mechanisms in complex pore geometries require simulation models with local mass conservation and with the option to improve resolution in areas of interest. In this work, we incorporate patch-based, structured adaptive mesh refinement capabilities into a method for local volume conservation that describes the behaviour of disconnected fluid ganglia during level set simulations of capillary-controlled displacement in porous media. We validate the model against analytical solutions for three-phase fluid configurations in idealized pores containing gas, oil, and water, by modelling the intermediate-wet oil layers as separate domains with their volumes preserved. Both the pressures and volumes of disconnected ganglia converge to analytical values with increased refinement levels of the adaptive mesh. Favourable results from strong and weak scaling tests emphasize that the number of patches per processor and the total number of patches are important parameters for efficient parallel simulations with adaptive mesh refinement. Simulations of two-phase imbibition and three-phase gas invasion on segmented 3D images of water-wet sandstone show that adaptive mesh refinement has the highest impact on three-phase displacements, especially concerning the behaviour of the conserved, intermediate-wet phase.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn 3D geo-electromagnetic modeling, an adequate discretisation of the modeling domain is crucial to obtain accurate forward responses and reliable inversion results while reducing the computational cost. This paper investigates the mesh design for subsurface models, including steel-cased wells, which is relevant for many exploration settings but still remains a numerically challenging task. Applying a goal-oriented mesh refinement technique and subsequent calculations with the high-order edge finite element method, simulations of 3D controlled-source electromagnetic models in the presence of metallic infrastructure are performed. Two test models are considered, each needing a distinct version of approximation methods to incorporate the conductive steel casings of the included wells. The influence of mesh quality, goal-oriented meshing, and high-order approximations on problem sizes, computational cost, and accuracy of electromagnetic responses is investigated. The main insights of our work are: (a) the applied numerical schemes can mitigate the computational burden of geo-electromagnetic modeling in the presence of steel artifacts; (b) investigating the processes driving the meshing of models with embedded metallic infrastructures can lead to adequate strategies to deal with the inversion of such electromagnetic data sets. Based on the modeling results and analyses conducted, general recommendations for modeling strategies are proposed when performing simulations for challenging steel infrastructure scenarios.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWhile the share of renewable energy sources increased within the last years with an ongoing upward trend, the energy sector is facing the problem of storing large amounts of electrical energy properly. To compensate daily and seasonal fluctuations, a sufficient storage system has to be developed. The storage of hydrogen in the subsurface, referred to as Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS), shows potential to be a solution for this problem. Hydrogen, produced from excess energy via electrolysis, is injected into a subsurface reservoir and withdrawn when required. As hydrogen possesses unique thermodynamic properties, many commonly used correlations can not be simply transferred to a system with a high hydrogen content. Mixing processes with the present fluids are essential to be understood to achieve high storage efficiencies. Additionally, in the past, microbial activity, e.g. by methanogenic archaea, was observed, leading to a changing fluid composition over time. To evaluate the capability of reservoir simulators to cover these processes, the present study establishes a benchmark scenario of an exemplary underground hydrogen storage scenario. The benchmark comprises of a generic sandstone gas reservoir and a typical gas storage schedule is defined. Based on this benchmark, the present study assesses the capabilities of the commercial simulator Schlumberger ECLIPSE and the open-source simulator DuMux to mimic UHS related processes such as hydrodynamics but also microbial activity. While ECLIPSE offers a reasonable mix of user-friendliness and computation time, DuMux allows for a better adjustment of correlations and the implementation of biochemical reactions. The corresponding input data (ECLIPSE format) and relevant results are provided in a repository to allow this simulation study’s reproduction and extension.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThis work proposes a novel meshing technique that is able to extract surfaces from processed seismic data and integrate surfaces that were constructed using other extraction techniques. Contrary to other existing methods, the process is fully automated and does not require any user intervention. The proposed system includes an approach for closing the gaps that arise from the different techniques used for surface extraction. The developed process is able to handle non-manifold domains that result from multiple surface intersections. Surface and volume meshing that comply with user specified mesh control techniques are implemented to ensure the desired mesh quality. The integrated procedures provide a unique facility to handle geotechnical models and accelerate the generation of quality meshes for geophysics modelling. The developed procedure enables the creation of meshes for complex reservoir models to be reduced from weeks to a few hours. Various industrial examples are shown to demonstrate the practicable use of the developed approach to handle real life data.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThis work investigates the performance of the on-demand machine learning (ODML) algorithm introduced in Leal et al. (Transp. Porous Media 133(2), 161–204, 2020) when applied to different reactive transport problems in heterogeneous porous media. This approach was devised to accelerate the computationally expensive geochemical reaction calculations in reactive transport simulations. We demonstrate that even with a strong heterogeneity present, the ODML algorithm speeds up these calculations by one to three orders of magnitude. Such acceleration, in turn, significantly advances the entire reactive transport simulation. The performed numerical experiments are enabled by the novel coupling of two open-source software packages: Reaktoro (Leal 2015) and Firedrake (Rathgeber et al. ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 43(3), 2016). The first library provides the most recent version of the ODML approach for the chemical equilibrium calculations, whereas, the second framework includes the newly implemented conservative Discontinuous Galerkin finite element scheme for the Darcy problem, i.e., the Stabilized Dual Hybrid Mixed (SDHM) method Núñez et al. (Int. J. Model. Simul. Petroleum Industry, 6, 2012).\n",

      "abstract AbstractCurrent shallow granular flow models suited to arbitrary topography can be divided into two types, those formulated in bed-fitted curvilinear coordinates and those formulated in global Cartesian coordinates. The shallow granular flow model of Denlinger and Iverson (J. Geophys. Res. 109, F01014, 2004) and the Boussinesq-type shallow granular flow theory of Castro-Orgaz et al. (2014) are formulated in a Cartesian coordinate system (with z vertical), and both account for the effect of nonzero vertical acceleration on depth-averaged momentum fluxes and stress states. In this paper, we first reformulate the vertical normal stress of Castro-Orgaz et al. (2014) in a quadratic polynomial in the relative elevation η. This form allows for analytical depth integration of the vertical normal stress. We then calculate the basal normal stress based on the basal friction law and scaling analysis. These calculations, plus certain constitutive relations, lead to a refined full non-hydrostatic shallow granular flow model, which is further rewritten in a form of Boussinesq-type water wave equations for future numerical studies. In the present numerical study, we apply the open-source code TITAN2D for numerical solution of a low-order version of the full model involving only a mean vertical acceleration correction term. To cure the numerical instability related with discretization of the enhanced gravity, we propose an approximate formula for the enhanced gravity by utilizing the hydrostatic pressure assumption in the bed normal direction. Numerical calculations are conducted for several test cases involving steep slopes. Comparison with a bed-fitted model shows that even the simplified non-hydrostatic Cartesian model can be used to simulate shallow granular flows over arbitrary topography.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThere are several issues to consider when we use ensemble smoothers to condition reservoir models on rate data. The values in a time series of rate data contain redundant information that may lead to poorly conditioned inversions and thereby influence the stability of the numerical computation of the update. A time series of rate data typically has correlated measurement errors in time, and negligence of the correlations leads to a too strong impact from conditioning on the rate data and possible ensemble collapse. The total number of rate data included in the smoother update will typically exceed the ensemble size, and special care needs to be taken to ensure numerically stable results. We force the reservoir model with production rate data derived from the observed production, and the further conditioning on the same rate data implies that we use the data twice. This paper discusses strategies for conditioning reservoir models on rate data using ensemble smoothers. In particular, a significant redundancy in the rate data makes it possible to subsample the rate data. The alternative to subsampling is to model the unknown measurement error correlations and specify the full measurement error covariance matrix. We demonstrate the proposed strategies using different ensemble smoothers with the Norne full-field reservoir model.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAccurate modeling of elastic wavefields in 3-D anisotropic media is important for many seismic processing and inversion applications. However, efficient wavefield simulation for tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media and, especially, for orthorhombic and lower symmetries remains challenging. Finite-difference (FD) implementations using centered Taylor-series coefficients on singly staggered grids suffer from reduced numerical accuracy due to problems in computing the partial wavefield derivatives in TTI or tilted orthorhombic (TOR) media, as well as in enforcing the free-surface (zero-traction) boundary conditions. To address these issues, we develop a 3-D mimetic FD (MFD) algorithm for arbitrarily anisotropic media that uses a fully-staggered-grid strategy. This CUDA-based algorithm is implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to leverage the massive parallelism of this computer architecture. For multi-GPU parallelization, we employ the CUDA-aware message passing interface (MPI) library to exploit the remote direct memory access (RDMA) feature for buffer transfers. Weak- and strong-scaling tests on up to eight DGX NVIDIA A100 nodes (64 GPUs in total) demonstrate that the proposed multi-GPU implementation achieves a quasi-linear computational speedup with over 98% efficiency for large industrial-scale models of size in excess of 1.7\\(\\times \\)10\\(^{10}\\) grid points.\n",

      "abstract AbstractReservoir simulators are highly complex computer programs and are often treated as “black boxes” that act on standardized input formats. In part, this is due to the closed-source nature of commercial offerings commonly used in industry, but even when the source-code is available, modification of a fully featured simulator can be a daunting task: A reservoir simulation problem, when fully specified, can have a great number of parameters and functional relationships that are tightly coupled together in most implementations. This is an obstacle to workflows that go beyond forecasting and into optimization, parameter fitting and sensitivity analysis where the solution quantity of interest should be paired with gradients taken with respect to forces and parameters. The monolithic design of typical reservoir simulation codes cannot be separated from the technical and mathematical choices made when discretizing the governing equations: The implicitness required to handle pressure changes and strong coupling between different solution variables means that the Jacobian of the governing equations must be implemented with respect to the primary variables: An error-prone process when done manually, and highly time-consuming when considering coupled systems. Automatic differentiation (AD) is a common cure to this problem that can generate Jacobians, but often comes at a severe cost in runtime performance. A more practical issue is that high computational performance for simulation problems relevant to modern geoenergy operations necessitates implementation in a compiled language while optimization and history matching workflows that integrate many data sources are most naturally expressed in high-level scripting languages. We describe the design of JutulDarcy, an open-source porous media simulator written in the Julia language. JutulDarcy is designed from the ground up with extensibility and computation of sensitivities in mind, starting from the assumption that high-performance automatic differentiation enables us to radically rethink the way simulators are designed. Highlights of this design include arbitrary execution graphs for the equation terms, in which dependence relationships can be re-configured on the fly, easy coupling of models, computation of sensitivities with respect to all model parameters through an adjoint method with a parameter declaration system, and an assembly process with performance that can exceed that of compiled simulators with hand-coded Jacobians. We validate the simulator on a number of standard test cases (immiscible, black-oil, CO2 and compositional flow) and demonstrate MPI parallel performance on multi-million cell models. In addition, we offer a frank assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Julia programming language for scientific computing.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSurface tension affects all aspects of fluid flow in porous media. Through measurements of surface tension interaction under multiphase conditions, a relative permeability curve can be determined. Relative permeability is a numerical description of the interaction between two or more fluids and the porous media. It is a critical parameter for various tools that characterize subsurface multiphase flow systems, such as numerical simulation for carbon sequestration, oil and gas development, and groundwater contamination remediation. Therefore, it is critical to get a good statistical distribution of relative permeability in the porous media under study. Empirical formula for determining relative permeability from capillary pressure are already well established but do not provide the needed flexibility that is required to match laboratory-derived relative permeability curves. By expanding the existing methods for calculating relative permeability from capillary pressure data, it is possible to create both two and three-phase relative permeability curves. Mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) data from the Morrow 'B' Sandstone coupled with interfacial tension and contact angle measurements were used to create a suite of relative permeability curves. These curves were then calibrated to a small sample of existing laboratory curves to elucidate common fitting parameters for the formation that were then used to create relative permeability curves from MICP data that does not have an associated laboratory-measured relative permeability curve.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe present a multifidelity Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for efficient uncertainty quantification in CO\\(_2\\) storage applications. By combining full-physics reservoir models with reduced-order vertical equilibrium (VE) models, the approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy. VE models, which assume vertical equilibrium and model only lateral flow, enable rapid simulation of complex, layered reservoirs. We demonstrate the method on realistic case studies, including the Johansen and Sleipner sites, showing that MLMC with VE can significantly reduce simulation time compared to standard Monte Carlo methods. This makes large-scale ensemble simulations feasible for applications such as storage capacity estimation and improved uncertainty estimates to be used in value-of-information (VOI) monitoring design.\n",

      "abstract AbstractReservoir simulation is traditionally based on the assumption that water is an inert phase, while hydrocarbon components split into oil and gas phases. This approach is usually reasonable when modeling conventional hydrocarbon recovery, but specific applications may require accounting for mass exchange between the water and hydrocarbon phases. We here present the extension of our Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) compositional reservoir simulator (Esler et al. SPE J. 27(01), 597–612, 2021) to support gas-water equilibrium. Specifically, the Søreide and Whitson equation of state (EoS) (Søreide and Whitson Fluid Phase Equilib. 77, 217–240, 1992) was implemented to compute mutual solubilities of hydrocarbon/brine mixtures. The impact of salinity on phase equilibrium is accounted for, with salt being treated as an active tracer. The simulator uses a mass-variables formulation, meaning that little modifications to the construction of transport equations and Jacobian assembly was required; most of the required code changes are localized in the EoS module for the computation of component fugacities, and phase properties such as partial molar fractions and partial molar volumes. Treating salt as an active tracer instead of defining a further pseudo-component has an important advantage with the Søreide and Whitson EoS. If salinity changes as in water vaporization processes, our choice ensures that flash iterations can still be cast as a Gibbs Minimization problem with salinity being a constant parameter. On the contrary, salinity would change as flash iterations progress, jeopardizing the thermodynamic consistency of the phase equilibria. The overall reservoir simulation system of equations is still accurate to first order in time, at the cost of possibly slight volume imbalances at the end of converged timesteps. In this paper, we focused on CO\\(_2\\) sequestration in saline aquifers, where solubility trapping is a key mechanism. The accuracy of our implementation with respect to conventional CPU ones is first demonstrated on a synthetic box model. We then select an open-access aquifer model (Gassnova 2016) to illustrate its applicability in an industrial setting. Finally, we show how being able to seamlessly run high resolution models allows for modeling of convective mixing. A key conclusion of this work is that the extreme performance of GPU-based reservoir simulation naturally transfers to new fields of study, which is critical when modeling saline aquifers whose extent is an order of magnitude larger than that of typical oil and gas fields.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThere is a rising interest in developing robust and efficient sequential methods for reservoir simulation due to potential benefits from specialized nonlinear and linear solvers, flexible discretizations, and adaptivity. The recently proposed sequential fully implicit Newton (SFIN) method addresses a major bottleneck of the sequential strategies: the slow sequential coupling convergence when flow and transport problems are strongly coupled. However, the original SFIN algorithm requires fixed primary variables during the simulation. For the natural formulation widely used in reservoir simulation, primary variables will switch when a phase change happens. In this work, we proposed strategies to address the issue of inconsistent primary variables and extended the SFIN method to the natural black-oil formulation. Several challenging numerical cases are presented to demonstrate that the extended SFIN method can achieve significant sequential convergence acceleration and improved overall performance for natural formulation when phase changes and primary variable switch happen frequently.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWater flow in partially saturated porous media is of importance in many disciplines such as hydrology, agriculture, environmental management or geotechnical engineering. A robust and accurate solution methodology applicable across the range of soils, initial and boundary conditions found in practice is difficult to identify. Three mass conservative iteration schemes for the approximation of the flow equation in partially saturated porous media are evaluated considering large contrasts in soil texture, initial moisture and boundary conditions typically found in real world application. The three schemes reviewed are the well established modified Picard algorithm (Celia-Scheme), and two promising approaches the L-Scheme and the Casulli-Scheme. A systematic variation of soil texture and initial moisture in an intense rainfall infiltration scenario is set up in order to consider the numerical challenges associated with high non-linearity. The present analysis provides insights into robustness and efficiency in solving variably saturated flow across the range of soils, initial and boundary conditions found in practice. Casulli’s scheme, in particular, provides an acceptable compromise between robustness and execution duration even under the severest conditions investigated, while the other schemes sacrifice one for the sake of the other. The authors believe that advances in the development of numerical schemes for partly saturated flow require the kind of methodology presented here in combination with relevant benchmark problems in order to enable a fair evaluation and comparison of numerical techniques across the related disciplines.\n",

      "abstract AbstractRegional groundwater modelling can provide decision-makers and scientists with valuable information required for the sustainable use and protection of groundwater resources in the future. In order to assess and manage the impact of climate change on regional aquifer systems, numerical groundwater models are required which represent the subsurface structures of aquifers and aquitards in 3D at the regional scale and beyond in the most efficient way. A workflow to clearly generate these structural subsurface representations from a variety of data sources is introduced, applying open-source Geographical Information Systems. The resulting structural models can be used with finite element method-based simulation tools, such as the open-source environment OpenGeoSys. The preparation workflow of the structure model is presented for a large river basin in Germany, indicating the applicability of the method even in a challenging hydrogeological region with several stockworks of dipped and fractured sedimentary aquifers, partially showing significantly changing hydraulic conditions due to natural lateral facies changes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe metamodel-based approach (also referred to as the surrogate approach) is commonly applied to overcome the computational burden of numerical models that are used to simulate the evolution of reservoir fluids and pressures in response to any production scheme. In this study, we propose an adaptation of this approach for aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) systems. ATES systems are characterized by cyclic loading/unloading production schemes, which result in a strong similarity in the dynamics of the intercyclic evolution of variables such as the temperature at the producer well. Instead of training several metamodels, i.e., one per cycle (“independent” metamodelling approach), we take advantage of the intercyclic similarity to train a single metamodel within the setting of multifidelity cokriging (“multicyclic” metamodelling approach). To explore the predictive performance of this approach, we applied a random subsampling validation approach multiple times to 300 simulation results of a realistic ATES system in the Paris basin by considering three characteristics, i.e., the minimum and maximum temperature, and the rate of temperature decrease at each cycle. Numerical experiments with varying training dataset sizes (from 33 to 66% of the total number of results) and using 100 test samples show that (1) the predictive error of the multicyclic metamodelling reaches lower levels (by 20–50%) than that of the independent approach; (2) this higher predictive performance is achieved while saving computational time cost because the training phase only needs a few tens of “complete” simulations (run over all cycles) together with a few hundreds of “partial” simulations (stopped at the first cycle); the latter simulations are less expensive to evaluate because of shorter simulated time.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMarkov chain geostatistics is a methodology for simulating categorical fields. Its fundamental model for conditional simulation is the Markov chain random field (MCRF) model, with the transiogram serving as its basic spatial correlation measure. There are different methods to obtain transiogram models for MCRF simulation based on sample data and expert knowledge: linear interpolation, mathematical model joint-fitting, and a mixed approach combining both. This study aims to explore the sensitivity of the MCRF model to different transiogram jointing modeling methods. Two case studies were conducted to examine how simulated results, including optimal prediction maps and simulated realization maps, vary with different sets of transiogram models. The results indicate that all three transiogram joint modeling methods are applicable, and the MCRF model exhibits a general insensitivity to transiogram models produced by different methods, particularly when sample data are sufficient to generate reliable experimental transiograms. The variations in overall simulation accuracies based on different sets of transiogram models are not significant. However, notable improvements in simulation accuracy for minor classes were observed when theoretical transiogram models (generated by mathematical model fitting with expert knowledge) were utilized. This study suggests that methods for deriving transiogram models from experimental transiograms perform well in conditional simulations of categorical soil variables when meaningful experimental transiograms can be estimated. Employing mathematical models for transiogram modeling of minor classes provides a way to incorporate expert knowledge and improve the simulation accuracy of minor classes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn reservoir simulation, it is important to understand the mechanical behaviour of fractured rocks and the effect of shear and tensile displacements of fractures on their aperture. Tensile opening directly enhances the fracture aperture, whereas shear of a preexisting rough-walled fracture creates aperture changes dependent on the local stress state. Since fracture dilatation increases reservoir permeability, both processes must be included in a realistic and consistent manner into the mechanical reservoir simulation model. Here, we use the extended finite volume method (XFVM) to conduct flow and geomechanics simulations. In XFVM, fractures are embedded in a poroelastic matrix and are modelled with discontinuous basis functions. On each fracture segment the tractions and compressive forces are calculated, and one extra degree of freedom is added for both the shear and tensile displacement. In this particular XFVM implementation we assume that linear elasticity and steady state fluid pressure adequately constrain the effective stress. In this paper, shear dilation is not calculated a posteriori, but it enters the equations such that aperture changes directly affect the stress state. This is accomplished by adding shear dilation to the displacement gradients and therefore ascertains a consistent representation in the stress-strain relations and force balances. We illustrate and discuss the influence of this extra term in two simple test cases and in a realistic layer-restricted two-dimensional fracture network subjected to plausible in situ stress and pore pressure conditions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTraditional stochastic algorithms for characterizing fracture networks are purely based on statistical inferences from outcrop images, and therefore the models produced, may not be physically realistic because they may not be consistent with the process of propagation and termination of fractures. These processes are better represented in geomechanical models of the fracturing process. However, full-physics numerical models are computationally inefficient for modeling fractures at a reservoir scale while accounting for material heterogeneities. More importantly, geomechanical simulations yield deterministic results, thus failing to represent the inherent uncertainties due to input properties and paleo stress conditions. In order to facilitate geomechanical characterization, in this research, a number of small-scale, high fidelity, finite discrete element method (FDEM) based forward models are executed and the relationship between prevailing stress conditions and the fracture propagation direction is inferred using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. We develop a ML based fracture network modeling approach that is orders of magnitude faster, efficiently scalable and may extend the capabilities of statistical fracture modeling approaches by accounting for the physical process of fracture propagation and uncertainties associated with geomechanical parameters. The application and effectiveness of this ML based modeling approach is demonstrated using a synthetic case and a case study from Teapot Dome, Wyoming based on the fracture characteristics inferred from the FMI logs near well 67-1-x-10 in the Tensleep Formation reported by Schwartz (2006).\n",

      "abstract AbstractAir pollution poses a major threat to health, environment, and global climate. Characterizing the emission parameters responsible for air contamination can help formulate appropriate response plans. We propose an advanced methodology that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling within a Bayesian inference framework to invert for emission parameters of air contamination in an urban environment. We also use a high-resolution Lagrangian dispersion model to provide microscale wind computations as well as pollution concentration values in the presence of urban features with high complexity. Buildings and land use features were all integrated in a realistic urban setup that represents the region of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KSA. Boundary meteorological conditions acquired from a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation were employed to obtain the mesoscale wind field. We design numerical experiments to infer two common types of reference observations, a pollutant concentration distribution and point-wise discrete concentration values. The local \\(L_2\\) norm and global Wasserstein distance are investigated to quantify the discrepancies between the observations and the model predictions. The results of the conducted numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of using the global optimal transport metric. They also emphasize the sensitivity of the inverted solution to the available observations. The proposed framework is proven to efficiently provide robust estimates of the emission parameters.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMonitoring is an important component of geological carbon storage operations because it provides data that can be used to estimate key quantities such as CO\\(_{2}\\) plume location. The design of the monitoring strategy is complicated, however, because the monitoring plan must be established prior to the availability of extensive flow data. In this work, we present and apply a framework that integrates monitoring well optimization and (subsequent) history matching. The monitoring well optimization entails finding the locations of monitoring wells such that, with the data acquired at those locations, the expected uncertainty reduction in a particular flow quantity is maximized. This optimization requires the simulation of a large set of prior models, though these simulations need only be performed once for a given injection scenario. Once the monitoring wells are in place and CO\\(_{2}\\) injection begins, history matching is performed using the monitoring data. This is accomplished here using an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation. The overall framework is applied to variogram-based geomodels that are representative of an actual storage project under development in the USA. Two injection scenarios are considered with two different (synthetic) ‘true’ models, which provide the observed data. History matched models are constructed using data from both optimally located and heuristically placed monitoring wells. Posterior uncertainty, evaluated in terms of the cumulative distribution function for a metric related to plume extent over the ensemble of history matched models, is shown to be minimized through use of optimized monitoring wells. These results demonstrate the importance of optimizing the monitoring plan, and the degree of uncertainty reduction that can be realistically achieved.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we propose multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods that use ensemble level mixed multiscale methods in the simulations of multiphase flow and transport. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) a design of ensemble level mixed multiscale finite element methods and (2) a novel use of mixed multiscale finite element methods within multilevel Monte Carlo techniques to speed up the computations. The main idea of ensemble level multiscale methods is to construct local multiscale basis functions that can be used for any member of the ensemble. In this paper, we consider two ensemble level mixed multiscale finite element methods: (1) the no-local-solve-online ensemble level method (NLSO); and (2) the local-solve-online ensemble level method (LSO). The first approach was proposed in Aarnes and Efendiev (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 30(5):2319-2339, 2008) while the second approach is new. Both mixed multiscale methods use a number of snapshots of the permeability media in generating multiscale basis functions. As a result, in the off-line stage, we construct multiple basis functions for each coarse region where basis functions correspond to different realizations. In the no-local-solve-online ensemble level method, one uses the whole set of precomputed basis functions to approximate the solution for an arbitrary realization. In the local-solve-online ensemble level method, one uses the precomputed functions to construct a multiscale basis for a particular realization. With this basis, the solution corresponding to this particular realization is approximated in LSO mixed multiscale finite element method (MsFEM). In both approaches, the accuracy of the method is related to the number of snapshots computed based on different realizations that one uses to precompute a multiscale basis. In this paper, ensemble level multiscale methods are used in multilevel Monte Carlo methods (Giles 2008a, Oper.Res. 56(3):607-617, b). In multilevel Monte Carlo methods, more accurate (and expensive) forward simulations are run with fewer samples, while less accurate (and inexpensive) forward simulations are run with a larger number of samples. Selecting the number of expensive and inexpensive simulations based on the number of coarse degrees of freedom, one can show that MLMC methods can provide better accuracy at the same cost as Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The main objective of the paper is twofold. First, we would like to compare NLSO and LSO mixed MsFEMs. Further, we use both approaches in the context of MLMC to speedup MC calculations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractUranium In Situ Recovery (ISR) is based on the direct leaching of the uranium ore in the deposit by a mining solution. Fluid flow and geochemical reaction in the reservoir are difficult to predict due to geological, petrophysical and geochemical uncertainties. The reactive transport simulation code used to model ISR is very sensitive to the spatial distribution of physical and chemical properties of the deposit. Stochastic geostatistical models are used to represent the uncertainty on the spatial distribution of geological properties. The direct propagation of geological uncertainties by multiple ISR mining simulations is intractable in an industrial context. The CPU time needed to perform one ISR numerical simulation is too heavy. This work presents a way to propagate geological uncertainties into uranium production uncertainties at a reduced computational cost, thanks to a scenario reduction method. A subset of geostatistical simulations is built to approximate the variability of a larger set. The selection is obtained using a proxy of reactive transport simulation. The main contribution of this work is the development of the proxy, which is based on an artificial mineral exploitation that has common properties with uraninite. It allows the discrimination of geostatistical realizations in terms of potential uranium production. Then, the ISR simulation carried out with the selected geostatistical realizations gives a good approximation of the uranium production variability over the whole set of geostatistical simulations. This approximation is then used to quantify the uncertainties on the uranium production. The proposed approach is assessed on real case studies.\n",

      "abstract AbstractGoverning equations of physical problems are traditionally derived from conservation laws or physical principles. However, some complex problems still exist for which these first-principle derivations cannot be implemented. As data acquisition and storage ability have increased, data-driven methods have attracted great attention. In recent years, several works have addressed how to learn dynamical systems and partial differential equations using data-driven methods. Along this line, in this work, we investigate how to discover subsurface flow equations from data via a machine learning technique, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The learning of single-phase groundwater flow equation and contaminant transport equation are demonstrated. Considering that the parameters of subsurface formation are usually heterogeneous, we propose a procedure for learning partial differential equations with heterogeneous model parameters for the first time. Derivative calculation from discrete data is required for implementing equation learning, and we discuss how to calculate derivatives from noisy data. For a series of cases, the proposed data-driven method demonstrates satisfactory results for learning subsurface flow equations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe impact of organic matter on the flow capacity of shale oil rocks is presumably significant, and the knowledge about the representative size is fundamental for the upscaling studies. The error of the experimentally determined permeability values is comparable with the contribution of kerogen to shale permeability, instead a 2D numerical model is employed to explore the normalised equivalent permeability and the representative elementary area (REA) of shale oil rocks in detail incorporating the effects of kerogen. The discussions on the normalised equivalent permeability and the REA are based on the statistical average and standard deviation from 1000 different runs, respectively. The inorganic permeability heterogeneity is introduced based on the assumption of a lognormal pore size distribution and the Monte Carlo sampling method. The effects of kerogen geometric characteristics are incorporated by putting forward several representative cases for comparison. The effects of the organic permeability contrast (ratio of permeability to the inorganic permeability with no heterogeneity), total organic carbon (TOC, volume fraction), inorganic permeability heterogeneity and kerogen geometric characteristics on the normalised equivalent permeability (ratio of the intrinsic equivalent permeability to inorganic permeability with no heterogeneity) and the REA are discussed comprehensively. This work can provide a better understanding of shale oil rocks at the micrometer scale.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDimensional reduction strategy is an effective approach to derive reliable conceptual models to describe flow in fractured porous media. The fracture aperture is several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic size (e.g., the length of the fracture) of the physical problem. We identify the aperture to length ratio as the small parameter 𝜖 with the fracture permeability scaled as an exponent of 𝜖. We consider a non-Newtonian fluid described by the Carreau model type where the viscosity is dependent on the fluid velocity. Using formal asymptotic approach, we derive a catalogue of reduced models at the vanishing limit of 𝜖. Our derivation provides new models in a hybrid-dimensional setting as well as models which exhibit two-scale behaviour. Several numerical examples confirm the theoretical derivations of the upscaled models. Moreover, we have also studied the sensitivity of the upscaled models when a particular upscaled model is used beyond its range of validity to provide additional insight.\n",

      "abstract AbstractReservoir simulation models are frequently used to make decisions on well locations, recovery optimization strategies, etc. The success of these applications is, among other aspects, determined by the controllability and observability properties of the reservoir model. In this paper, it is shown how the controllability and observability of two-phase flow reservoir models can be analyzed and quantified with aid of generalized empirical Gramians. The empirical controllability Gramian can be interpreted as a spatial covariance of the states (pressures or saturations) in the reservoir resulting from input perturbations in the wells. The empirical observability Gramian can be interpreted as a spatial covariance of the measured bottom-hole pressures or well bore flow rates resulting from state perturbations. Based on examples in the form of simple homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoir models, we conclude that the position of the wells and of the front between reservoir fluids, and to a lesser extent the position and shape of permeability heterogeneities that impact the front, are the most important factors that determine the local controllability and observability properties of the reservoir.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we study newly developed methods for linear elasticity on polyhedral meshes. Our emphasis is on applications of the methods to geological models. Models of subsurface, and in particular sedimentary rocks, naturally lead to general polyhedral meshes. Numerical methods which can directly handle such representation are highly desirable. Many of the numerical challenges in simulation of subsurface applications come from the lack of robustness and accuracy of numerical methods in the case of highly distorted grids. In this paper, we investigate and compare the Multi-Point Stress Approximation (MPSA) and the Virtual Element Method (VEM) with regard to grid features that are frequently seen in geological models and likely to lead to a lack of accuracy of the methods. In particular, we look at how the methods perform near the incompressible limit. This work shows that both methods are promising for flexible modeling of subsurface mechanics.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe conventional paradigm for predicting future reservoir performance from existing production data involves the construction of reservoir models that match the historical data through iterative history matching. This is generally an expensive and difficult task and often results in models that do not accurately assess the uncertainty of the forecast. We propose an alternative re-formulation of the problem, in which the role of the reservoir model is reconsidered. Instead of using the model to match the historical production, and then forecasting, the model is used in combination with Monte Carlo sampling to establish a statistical relationship between the historical and forecast variables. The estimated relationship is then used in conjunction with the actual production data to produce a statistical forecast. This allows quantifying posterior uncertainty on the forecast variable without explicit inversion or history matching. The main rationale behind this is that the reservoir model is highly complex and even so, still remains a simplified representation of the actual subsurface. As statistical relationships can generally only be constructed in low dimensions, compression and dimension reduction of the reservoir models themselves would result in further oversimplification. Conversely, production data and forecast variables are time series data, which are simpler and much more applicable for dimension reduction techniques. We present a dimension reduction approach based on functional data analysis (FDA), and mixed principal component analysis (mixed PCA), followed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to maximize the linear correlation between the forecast and production variables. Using these transformed variables, it is then possible to apply linear Gaussian regression and estimate the statistical relationship between the forecast and historical variables. This relationship is used in combination with the actual observed historical data to estimate the posterior distribution of the forecast variable. Sampling from this posterior and reconstructing the corresponding forecast time series, allows assessing uncertainty on the forecast. This workflow will be demonstrated on a case based on a Libyan reservoir and compared with traditional history matching.\n",

      "abstract AbstractBayesian model selection objectively ranks competing models by computing Bayesian Model Evidence (BME) against test data. BME is the likelihood of data to occur under each model, averaged over uncertain parameters. Computing BME can be problematic: exact analytical solutions require strong assumptions; mathematical approximations (information criteria) are often strongly biased; assumption-free numerical methods (like Monte Carlo) are computationally impossible if the data set is large, for example like high-resolution snapshots from experimental movies. To use BME as ranking criterion in such cases, we develop the “Method of Forced Probabilities (MFP)”. MFP swaps the direction of evaluation: instead of comparing thousands of model runs on random model realizations with the observed movie snapshots, we force models to reproduce the data in each time step and record the individual probabilities of the model following these exact transitions. MFP is fast and accurate for models that fulfil the Markov property in time, paired with high-quality data sets that resolve all individual events. We demonstrate our approach on stochastic macro-invasion percolation models that simulate gas migration in porous media, and list additional examples of probable applications. The corresponding experimental movie was obtained from slow gas injection into water-saturated, homogeneous sand in a 25 x 25 x 1 cm acrylic glass tank. Despite the movie not always satisfying the high demands (resolving all individual events), we can apply MFP by suggesting a few workarounds. Results confirm that the proposed method can compute BME in previously unfeasible scenarios, facilitating a ranking among competing model versions for future model improvement.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe lithofacies analysis of logging data is an essential step in reservoir evaluation. Multiresolution graph-based clustering (MRGC) is a commonly used methodology that provides information on the best number of clusters and cluster fitting results for geological understanding. However, the cluster fusion approach of MRGC often leads to an overemphasis of the boundary constraints among clusters. MRGC neglects the global cluster distribution relationship, which limits its practical application effectiveness. This paper proposes a new methodology, named kernel multiresolution graph-based clustering (KMRGC), to improve the merging part of clustering in MRGC, and it can give more weight to the spatial relationship characteristics among clusters. The clustering performance of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), fuzzy c-means(FCM), Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCN), spectral clustering, MRGC and KMRGC algorithm was evaluated on a publicly available training set and noisy dataset, and the best results in terms of the adjusted Rand coefficients and normalized mutual information(NMI) coefficients on most of the datasets were obtained using KMRGC algorithm. Finally, KMRGC was used for logging data lithofacies clustering in cased wells, and the clustering effect of KMRGC algorithm was much better than that of the K-means, GMM, FCM, DBSCN, spectral clustering and MRGC algorithms, and the accuracy and stability were better.\n",

      "abstract AbstractResistivity and acoustic logs are widely used to estimate gas hydrate saturation in various sedimentary systems using one of the two popular methods ((1) acoustic velocity and (2) electrical resistivity), but the limitations of these two methods are often overlooked, which include (i) well-specific calibration of empirical exponents in the electrical resistivity method, (ii) assumption of known pore morphology for gas hydrates in the acoustic velocity method, and (iii) presence of unknown mineralogy and bulk modulus terms in the acoustic velocity method. NMR-density porosity-derived gas hydrate saturation based on the analysis of the transverse magnetization relaxation time (T2) is considered the most precise method, but acquisition of NMR-based logs is limited at relatively recent drilled sites; additionally, its use in conventional oil and gas reservoirs is not that common due to higher cost and operational deployment limitations associated with acquiring NMR well-logs. This study proposes a new method that predicts gas hydrate saturation (Sh) for any well using porosity, bulk density, and compressional wave (P wave) velocity well-logs with neural network (or stochastic gradient descent regression) without any well-specific calibration and/or other aforementioned shortcomings of the existing methods. The method is developed by examining the underlying dependency between Sh and different combinations of well-logs, chosen from 6 routine logs, with 12 different machine learning (ML) algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed method in predicting Sh is ~ 84%, which is better than the accuracy of seismic and electrical resistivity methods (≤ 75%) per the results reported by three different studies. The robustness of the method in the specific case of permafrost-associated gas hydrates is demonstrated with well-log data from two wells drilled on the Alaska North Slope.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEnsemble smoothers are among the most successful and efficient techniques currently available for history matching. However, because these methods rely on Gaussian assumptions, their performance is severely degraded when the prior geology is described in terms of complex facies distributions. Inspired by the impressive results obtained by deep generative networks in areas such as image and video generation, we started an investigation focused on the use of autoencoders to construct a continuous parameterization for facies models. In our previous publication, we combined a convolutional variational autoencoder (VAE) with the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) for history matching production data in models generated with multiple-point geostatistics. Despite the good results reported in our previous publication, a major limitation of the designed parameterization is the fact that it does not allow applying distance-based localization during the ensemble smoother update, which limits its application in large-scale problems. The present work is a continuation of this research project focusing on two aspects: firstly, we benchmark nine different formulations, including VAE, generative adversarial network (GAN), Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), WGAN with gradient penalty, WGAN with spectral normalization, variational auto-encoding GAN, principal component analysis (PCA) with cycle GAN, PCA with transfer style network, and VAE with style loss. These formulations are tested in a synthetic history matching problem with channelized facies. Secondly, we propose two strategies to allow the use of distance-based localization with the deep learning parameterizations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractOptimizing well placement is one of the primary challenges in oil field development. The number and positions of wells must be carefully considered, as it is directly related to the infrastructure cost and the profits over the field’s life cycle. In this paper, we propose three estimation of distribution algorithms to optimize well placement with the objective of maximizing the net present value. The methods are guided by an elite set of solutions and are able to obtain multiple local optima in a single run. We also present an auxiliary regression model to preemptively discard candidate solutions with poor performance prediction, thus avoiding running computationally expensive simulations for unpromising candidates. The model is trained with the data obtained during the search process and does not require previous training. Our algorithms yielded a significant improvement compared to a state-of-the-art reference method from the literature, as evidenced by computational experiments with two benchmarks.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDecisions regarding problem conceptualization, search approach, and how best to parametrize optimization methods for practical application are key to successful implementation of optimization approaches within georesources field development projects. This work provides decision support regarding the application of derivative-free search approaches for concurrent optimization of inflow control valves (ICVs) and well controls. A set of state-of-the-art approaches possessing different search features is implemented over two reference cases, and their performance, resource requirements, and specific method configurations are compared across multiple problem formulations for completion design. In this study, problem formulations to optimize completion design comprise fixed ICVs and piecewise-constant well controls. The design is optimized by several derivative-free methodologies relying on parallel pattern-search (tAPPS), population-based stochastic sampling (tPSO) and trust-region interpolation-based models (tDFTR). These methodologies are tested on a heterogeneous two-dimensional case and on a realistic case based on a section of the Olympus benchmark model. Three problem formulations are applied in both cases, i.e., one formulation optimizes ICV settings only, while two joint configurations also treat producer and injector controls as variables. Various method parametrizations across the range of cases and problem formulations exploit the different search features to improve convergence, achieve final objectives and infer response surface features. The scope of this particular study treats only deterministic problem formulations. Results outline performance trade-offs between parallelizable algorithms (tAPPS, tPSO) with high total runtime search efficiency and the local-search trust-region approach (tDFTR) providing effective objective gains for a low number of cost function evaluations. tAPPS demonstrates robust performance across different problem formulations that can support exploration efforts, e.g., during a pre-drill design phase while multiple independent tDFTR runs can provide local tuning capability around established solutions in a time-constrained post-drill setting. Additional remarks regarding joint completion design optimization, comparison metrics, and relative algorithm performance given the varying problem formulations are also made.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSubsurface models are central pieces of information in different earth-related disciplines such as groundwater management and hydrocarbon reservoir characterization. These models are normally obtained using geostatistical simulation methods. Recently, methods based on deep learning algorithms have been applied as subsurface model generators. However, there are still challenges on how to include conditioning data and ensure model variability within a set of realizations. We illustrate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create unconditional and conditional facies models. Based on a synthetic facies dataset, we first train a Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN) to produce unconditional facies models. Then, we show how image-to-image translation based on a U-Net GAN framework, including noise-layers, content loss function and diversity loss function, is used to model conditioning geological facies. Results show that GANs are powerful models to capture complex geological facies patterns and to generate facies realizations indistinguishable from the ones comprising the training dataset. The U-Net GAN framework performs well in providing variable models while honoring conditioning data in several scenarios. The results shown herein are expected to spark a new generation of methods for subsurface geological facies with fragmentary measurements.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMinimization of a stochastic cost function is commonly used for approximate sampling in high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems with Gaussian prior distributions and multimodal posterior distributions. The density of the samples generated by minimization is not the desired target density, unless the observation operator is linear, but the distribution of samples is useful as a proposal density for importance sampling or for Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we focus on applications to sampling from multimodal posterior distributions in high dimensions. We first show that sampling from multimodal distributions is improved by computing all critical points instead of only minimizers of the objective function. For applications to high-dimensional geoscience inverse problems, we demonstrate an efficient approximate weighting that uses a low-rank Gauss-Newton approximation of the determinant of the Jacobian. The method is applied to two toy problems with known posterior distributions and a Darcy flow problem with multiple modes in the posterior.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe Edvard Grieg field is a highly complex and heterogeneous reservoir with an extensive fault structure and a mixture of sandstone, conglomerate, and shale. In this paper, we present a complete workflow for history matching the Edvard Grieg field using an ensemble smoother for Bayesian inference. An important aspect of the workflow is a methodology to check that the prior assumptions are suitable for assimilating the data, and procedures to verify that the posterior results are plausible and credible. We thoroughly describe several tools and visualization techniques for these purposes. Using these methods we show how to identify important parameters of the model. Furthermore, we utilize new compression methods for better handling large datasets. Simulating fluid flow and seismic response for reservoirs of this size and complexity requires high numerical resolution and accurate seismic models. We present a novel dual-model concept for a better representation of seismic data and attributes, that deploy different models for the underground depending on simulated properties. Results from history matching show that we can improve data matches for both production data and different seismic attributes. Updated parameters give new insight into the reservoir dynamics, and are calibrated to better represent water movement and pressure.\n",

      "abstract AbstractRapidly changing heterogeneous supercomputer architectures pose a great challenge to many scientific communities trying to leverage the latest technology in high-performance computing. Many existing projects with a long development history have resulted in a large amount of code that is not directly compatible with the latest accelerator architectures. Furthermore, due to limited resources of scientific institutions, developing and maintaining architecture-specific ports is generally unsustainable. In order to adapt to modern accelerator architectures, many projects rely on directive-based programming models or build the codebase tightly around a third-party domain-specific language or library. This introduces external dependencies out of control of the project. The presented paper tackles the issue by proposing a lightweight application-side adaptor layer for compute kernels and memory management resulting in a versatile and inexpensive adaptation of new accelerator architectures with little draw backs. A widely used hydrologic model demonstrates that such an approach pursued more than 20 years ago is still paying off with modern accelerator architectures as demonstrated by a very significant performance gain from NVIDIA A100 GPUs, high developer productivity, and minimally invasive implementation; all while the codebase is kept well maintainable in the long-term.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThis paper studies the problem of unsupervised detection of geometrically similar fragments (segments) in curves, in the context of boundary matching. The goal is to determine all pairs of sub-curves that are geometrically similar, under local scale invariance. In particular, we aim to locate the existence of a similar section (independent of length and/or orientation) in the second curve, to a section of the first curve, as indicated by the user. The proposed approach is based on a suitable distance matrix of the two given curves. Additionally, a suitable objective function is proposed to capture the trade-off between the similarity of the common sub-sequences and their lengths. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize this objective function via an efficient graph-based approach that capitalizes on Dynamic Time Warping to compare the two subcurves. We apply the proposed technique in the context of geometric matching of coastline pairs. This application is crucial for investigating the forcing factors related to the coastline evolution. The proposed method was successfully applied to global coastline data, yielding a bipartite graph with analytical point-to-point correspondences.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDespite the robustness of standard genetic algorithms in receiver functions inversion for crustal and uppermost mantle velocity-depth structure, one drawback is that towards the end of a ‘run’, only a few variations in solution ideas are explored. This may lead to the stagnation of the optimization process and can be a major drawback for large model dimensions. To mitigate this problem, we introduced a new selection method that retains the best features of explored models, with an extinction procedure that increases the exploration of the model space through the principle of self-organized criticality. We test the performance of the modified genetic algorithm technique by applying it to the inversion of synthetically generated receiver functions for crustal velocity structure and comparing the results with those obtained using a standard genetic algorithm. The test cases involve using 2 different objective functions, based on the L2 norm and cosine similarity, with 2 different model parameterizations of different model sizes. The results show that our modified genetic algorithm improves the inversion process by consistently obtaining best models with the lowest misfit values and a distribution of best models with less deviations from the true model values. With an improvement of computation time of up to 11.2%, the results suggest that the modified genetic algorithm is best suited to obtain higher accuracy results in shorter computation times which will be especially useful for higher dimension models needing larger pool sizes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractLarge-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship between the coarse block of fine-scale hydraulic conductivity fields and the corresponding hydraulic heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws (e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep learning models can be reduced greatly. Several cases of subsurface flow, with varying two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures and isotropic and anisotropic conditions, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based upscaling method. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved significantly compared to numerical upscaling.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTo accurately grasp the comprehensive geological features of fluvial reservoirs, it is necessary to exploit a robust modelling approach to visualize and reproduce the realistic spatial distribution that exhibits apparent and implicit depositional trends of fluvial regions. The traditional geostatistical modelling methods using stochastic modelling fail to capture the complex features of geological reservoirs and therefore cannot reflect satisfactory realistic patterns. Generative adversarial network (GAN), as one of the mainstream generative models of deep learning, performs well in unsupervised learning tasks. The concurrent single image GAN (ConSinGAN) is one of the variants of GAN. Based on ConSinGAN, conditional concurrent single image GAN (CCSGAN) is proposed in this paper to perform conditional simulation of fluvial reservoirs, through which the output of the model can be constrained by conditional data. The results show that ConSinGAN, with the introduction of conditional data, not only preserves the model and parameters for future use but also improves the quality of the simulation results compared to other modeling methods.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCoalbed methane plays a significant role for the sustainable utilizing of resources and ecological environment. Production capacity forecasting of coalbed methane wells can effectively guide the optimization of development schemes directly affecting the economic benefits. To overcome the inefficiency of traditional theory-based numerical simulators and their weak adaptability to observational data, we explore a potential and efficient alternative for modeling of production capacity in a data-driven approach. This study makes full use of dynamic production data and geological static data from 530 CBM wells. We develop a production capacity prediction model utilizing the extreme gradient boosting algorithm and incorporated bayesian optimization to implement an automated search for hyperparameters. The results demonstrate that the prediction model developed by extreme gradient boosting has a more powerful prediction performance with an R2 close to 0.9 compared to other machine learning or even deep learning. Moreover, the coupled framework of extreme gradient boosting and bayesian optimization can notably upgrade the prediction power of the production capacity model by about 8%. The analysis of influencing factors also illustrates that dynamic production data during the first three years of development can well characterize the coalbed methane adsorption–desorption-seepage features, which contribute to the construction of the production capacity model.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn the context of numerical modeling for the assessment of a radioactive waste repository in a tight clay formation, the question arises whether a standard two-phase flow formulation is sufficient to capture the dissipation of gas generated by the degradation of engineered barrier components, or whether more sophisticated constitutive relations, including those accounting for geomechanical effects in deformable materials, need to be incorporated. The appropriateness of using effective geomechanical and two-phase flow parameters in a performance assessment model is examined by inverse modeling, which is used to interpret the experimental data from oedometric gas injection experiments on core samples. Effective parameters are estimated using both a conventional two-phase flow formulation as well as alternative constitutive models that account for the volumetric deformation of the specimen. The conventional model is capable of reproducing the pressure and gas flow data observed in the experiment. However, axial strain data reflecting the expansion and compression of the specimen in response to gas injection are not reproducible by the simple pore deformation model. Joint inversions of all available flow and deformation data performed with different effective stress models lead to similar matches. This indicates that (a) the differences between the conceptual models are either minor, (b) they can be compensated by estimating effective model parameters, or (c) that the calibration data do not contain sufficient information to discriminate amongst the alternative models. Nevertheless, the use of a two-phase flow model with a refined pore deformation relationship appears appropriate for performance assessment calculations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this work, we propose a lattice Boltzmann method for thermal flows in porous media, and show that the governing equations for thermal flows in porous media can be recovered correctly through the Maxwell iteration. Unlike previous works, the current model is constructed under diffusive scaling such that the volume-average velocity and temperature computations are just related to the density/temperature distribution functions. This distinct feature makes the proposed method more concise than previous models. In particular, it can be directly used to simulate flow in porous media with anisotropic permeability without adopting any iteration procedure or assumptions. We then test the present model by considering the porous-media flows in a channel including and without including the anisotropic effect, and show that it has second-order convergence rate in space. Besides, we also adopt the present method to simulate the thermal flows in both the isotropic and anisotropic cavities. The results demonstrate the accuracy and capability of the present approach for simulating thermal flows in porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA key challenge in reservoir management and other fields of engineering involves optimizing a nonlinear function iteratively. Due to the lack of available gradients in commercial reservoir simulators the attention over the last decades has been on gradient free methods or gradient approximations. In particular, the ensemble-based optimization has gained popularity over the last decade due to its simplicity and efficient implementation when considering an ensemble of reservoir models. Typically, a regression type gradient approximation is used in a backtracking or line search setting. This paper introduces an approximation of the Hessian utilizing a Monte Carlo approximation of the natural gradient with respect to the covariance matrix. This Hessian approximation can further be implemented in a trust region approach in order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The advantages of using such approximations are demonstrated by testing the proposed algorithm on the Rosenbrock function and on a synthetic reservoir field.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe stress of rock-like materials first increases and then decreases with an increase in the strain, and finally become damaged under tensile or compressive loads. It is not suitable to use the traditional bond-based peridynamics model to simulate the crack propagation of rock-like materials. Based on the bond-based peridynamics theory, a constitutive model has here been proposed that can reflect the characteristic of the stress with an increase in strain (i.e., that the stress of the rock-like materials first increases and then decreases, and finally fails). This makes up for the weakness with the traditional bond-based peridynamics theory, which fails to reflect the stress-strain change in rock-like materials. The strain energy density of the proposed constitutive model of rock-like materials has been derived and compared against the classical elasticity theory to obtain the model constants with respect to the elasticity moduli for plane stress conditions. Based on the here proposed constitutive model for rock-like materials, a numerical solution program for rock-like materials has been written using the Fortran language. For different loading conditions, the crack propagation process for an intact specimen has been simulated and compared with experimental results. This was also the situation for a specimen with a pre-existing flaw, a single non-straight flaw, and with three pre-existing flaws for plane stress conditions. The numerical simulation results were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results. By using this proposed constitutive model, it was possible to simulate and predict the mechanical properties of rock-like materials, and the process of crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence under different loading conditions. The results from the present study can thus provide a reference for practical engineering.\n",

The Bayesian approach allows to estimate the source parameters of an oil spill from available observations. Sampling the posterior distribution, however, can be computationally prohibitive unless the forward model is replaced by an inexpensive surrogate. Yet the construction of globally accurate surrogates can be challenging when the forward model exhibits strong nonlinear variations. We present an iterative data-driven algorithm for the construction of polynomial chaos surrogates whose accuracy is localized in regions of high posterior probability. Two synthetic oil spill experiments, in which the construction of prior-based surrogates is not feasible, are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in estimating five source parameters. The algorithm successfully provided a good approximation of the posterior distribution and accelerated the estimation of the oil spill source parameters and their uncertainties by an order of 100 folds.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this work, a method for well log data classification is presented. The method relies on a coordinate transformation to restructure the data in an optimal way and a quasi-probabilistic interpolation technique capable of smoothing noisy data. The approach does not require case-specific design, is computationally efficient and provides a statistical characterization of the classification problem. Consequently, transition zones between facies can be modelled in a realistic fashion and intermediate rock types can be identified with ease. Apart from being capable of classifying unseen data with high accuracy, the technique can also be used as an informative quality and consistency assessment tool for manually classified data. The properties of the method are demonstrated on a realistic test case study.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEfficient heat exploitation strategies from geothermal systems demand for accurate and efficient simulation of coupled flow-heat equations on large-scale heterogeneous fractured formations. While the accuracy depends on honouring high-resolution discrete fractures and rock heterogeneities, specially avoiding excessive upscaled quantities, the efficiency can be maintained if scalable model-reduction computational frameworks are developed. Addressing both aspects, this work presents a multiscale formulation for geothermal reservoirs. To this end, the nonlinear time-dependent (transient) multiscale coarse-scale system is obtained, for both pressure and temperature unknowns, based on elliptic locally solved basis functions. These basis functions account for fine-scale heterogeneity and discrete fractures, leading to accurate and efficient simulation strategies. The flow-heat coupling is treated in a sequential implicit loop, where in each stage, the multiscale stage is complemented by an ILU(0) smoother stage to guarantee convergence to any desired accuracy. Numerical results are presented in 2D to systematically analyze the multiscale approximate solutions compared with the fine scale ones for many challenging cases, including the outcrop-based geological fractured field. These results show that the developed multiscale formulation casts a promising framework for the real-field enhanced geothermal formations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPresent-day innovations in seismic acquisition tools and techniques have enabled the acquisition of detailed seismic datasets, which in many cases are extremely large (on the order of terabytes to petabytes). However, data analysis tools for extracting information on critical subsurface features such as fractures are still evolving. Traditional methods rely on time-consuming iterative workflows, which involve computing seismic attributes, de-noising, and expert interpretation. Additionally, with the increasingly widespread acquisition of time-lapse seismic surveys (4D), there is a heightened demand for reliable automated workflows to assist feature interpretation from seismic data. We present a novel data-driven tool for fast fracture identification in BIG post-stack seismic datasets, motivated by techniques developed for real-time face detection. The proposed algorithm computes spatio-temporal amplitude statistics using Haar-like bases, in order to characterize the seismic amplitude properties that correspond to fracture occurrence in a unit window or voxel. Under this approach, the amplitude data is decomposed into a collection of simple-to-calculate “mini-attributes,” which carry information on the amplitude gradient and curvature characteristics at varying locations and scales. These features then serve as inputs to a cascade of boosted classification tree models, which select and combine the most discriminative features to develop a probabilistic binary classification model. This overall approach helps to eliminate the computationally intensive and subjective use of ad hoc seismic attributes in existing approaches. We first demonstrate the viability of the proposed methodology for identifying discrete macro-fractures in a 2D synthetic seismic dataset. Next, we validate the approach using 3D post-stack seismic data from the Niobrara Shale interval within the Teapot Dome field. We show the applicability of the proposed framework for identifying sub-seismic fractures, by considering the amplitude profile adjacent to interpreted formation microimager (FMI) well log data. The upscaled spatial distribution of the predicted fractures shows agreement with existing geological studies and aligns with interpreted large-scale faults within the interval of interest.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn subsurface flow modeling, compositional simulation is often required to model complex recovery processes, such as gas/CO 2 injection. However, compositional simulation on fine-scale geological models is still computationally expensive and even prohibitive. Most existing upscaling techniques focus on black-oil models. In this paper, we present a general framework to upscale two-phase multicomponent flow in compositional simulation. Unlike previous studies, our approach explicitly considers the upscaling of flow and thermodynamics. In the flow part, we introduce a new set of upscaled flow functions that account for the effects of compressibility. This is often ignored in the upscaling of black-oil models. In the upscaling of thermodynamics, we show that the oil and gas phases within a coarse block are not at chemical equilibrium. This non-equilibrium behavior is modeled by upscaled thermodynamic functions, which measure the difference between component fugacities among the oil and gas phases. We apply the approach to various gas injection problems with different compositional features, permeability heterogeneity, and coarsening ratios. It is shown that the proposed method accurately reproduces the averaged fine-scale solutions, such as component overall compositions, gas saturation, and density solutions in the compositional flow.\n",

The fixed stress split iterative scheme solves the flow subproblem with all components of the stress tensor frozen using a multipoint flux mixed finite element method, followed by the poromechanics subproblem using a conforming Galerkin method in every coupling iteration at each time step. The coupling iterations are repeated until convergence and Backward Euler is employed for time marching. The convergence analysis is based on studying the equations satisfied by the difference of iterates to show that the fixed stress split iterative scheme for anisotropic poroelasticity with Biot tensor is contractive. We also demonstrate that the scheme is numerically convergent using the classical Mandel’s problem solution for transverse isotropy.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA method that infers a statistical model, which describes a relation between the knowledge of a geologist (quantified by geological interpretations) and the available information (such as geophysical data, well log data, etc.) that a geologist uses when he/she interprets is proposed and tested. The statistical model is then used to perform automatic geological interpretations wherever the same kinds of information, as used for the initial interpretations, are available. This methodology is named Smart Interpretation (SI). In this study, we look at two different approaches to infer such a model, and we demonstrate the applicability of the model to predict the depth to a low resistivity subsurface layer, based on interpretations from a geological expert, using a 19-layered resistivity model obtained from inversion of airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data. This study shows that SI is capable of making predictions with great accuracy. The method is fast and is able to handle large amounts of data of different origin, which suggest that the method may become a very useful approach to assist in geological modeling based on increasingly large amounts of data of different nature.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA major part of world hydrocarbon resources is located in fractured reservoirs. The identification of fractured reservoir parameters is essential for their optimal production. The Warren-Root model is one of the most fundamental models for fluid flow in fractured reservoirs. The simplified assumption of the Warren-Root model is not applicable for a finite reservoir, and transition zone cannot be detected in finite fractured reservoirs. In this study, the significance of the fractured reservoir boundary effect in the Warren-Root equation is investigated. Also, the numerical solutions of the Warren-Root model are proposed for all types of boundary conditions. Results show that in some cases, it is impossible to diagnose the transition zone in fractured reservoirs from dimensionless curves due to the transition zone and boundary effect interference. This interference is specifically observed in finite fractured reservoirs and it is a function of the interprosity parameter (λ) and reservoir dimensionless radius (rDe). This functionality is presented and discussed in the cases of constant production rate and constant pressure production conditions. The proposed equations are applicable to all types of boundary conditions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we propose an energy-stable evolution method for the calculation of the phase equilibria under given volume, temperature, and moles (VT-flash). An evolution model for describing the dynamics of two-phase fluid system is based on Fick’s law of diffusion for multi-component fluids and the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The mobility is obtained from diffusion coefficients by relating the gradient of chemical potential to the gradient of molar density. The evolution equation for moles of each component is derived using the discretization of diffusion equations, while the volume evolution equation is constructed based on the mechanical mechanism and the Peng-Robinson equation of state. It is proven that the proposed evolution system can well model the VT-flash problem, and moreover, it possesses the property of total energy decay. By using the Euler time scheme to discretize this evolution system, we develop an energy stable algorithm with an adaptive choice strategy of time steps, which allows us to calculate the suitable time step size to guarantee the physical properties of moles and volumes, including positivity, maximum limits, and correct definition of the Helmhotz free energy function. The proposed evolution method is also proven to be energy-stable under the proposed time step choice. Numerical examples are tested to demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe objective of seismic imaging is to recover properties of the Earth from surface measurements recorded during active seismic surveys. Migration Velocity Analysis techniques aim at determining a background velocity model (smooth part of the pressure wave velocity model) using the redundancy of seismic data and consist of solving a nested optimisation problem. In the inner loop, an extended reflectivity model (detailed part of the model) is determined from recorded primary reflections through a data-fitting procedure depending on a given background model. In the outer loop, a coherency criterion defined on the extended reflectivity assesses the quality of the background model. The inner problem is usually solved with a single iteration of gradient optimisation, leading to artefacts in the velocity updates. We study the benefits of further iterating on the reflectivity in the inner loop, which also allows the introduction of multiple reflections in the procedure. We propose two strategies for the computation of the gradient of the outer objective function. In the first case, we compute the exact numerical gradient by taking care of the background dependency of all inner iterations. In the second case, we derive an approximate gradient by assuming the optimal reflectivity has been obtained. Both methods are compared on their computational merits and through simple numerical examples on 2D synthetic data sets. The examples illustrate that regularisation of the inner problem is essential to obtain coherent velocity updates. The second approach displays a smaller sensitivity to regularisation and is simpler to implement.\n",
