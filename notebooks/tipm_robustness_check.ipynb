      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we derive a pore-scale model for permeable biofilm formation in a two-dimensional pore. The pore is divided into two phases: water and biofilm. The biofilm is assumed to consist of four components: water, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), active bacteria, and dead bacteria. The flow of water is modeled by the Stokes equation, whereas a diffusion–convection equation is involved for the transport of nutrients. At the biofilm–water interface, nutrient transport and shear forces due to the water flux are considered. In the biofilm, the Brinkman equation for the water flow, transport of nutrients due to diffusion and convection, displacement of the biofilm components due to reproduction/death of bacteria, and production of EPS are considered. A segregated finite element algorithm is used to solve the mathematical equations. Numerical simulations are performed based on experimentally determined parameters. The stress coefficient is fitted to the experimental data. To identify the critical model parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed. The Sobol sensitivity indices of the input parameters are computed based on uniform perturbation by ± 10% of the nominal parameter values. The sensitivity analysis confirms that the variability or uncertainty in none of the parameters should be neglected.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMixing-driven reactions in porous media are ubiquitous and span natural and engineered environments, yet predicting where and how quickly reactions occur is immensely challenging due to the complex and nonuniform nature of porous media flows. In particular, in many instances, there is an enormous range of spatial and temporal scales over which reactants can mix. This paper aims to review factors that affect mixing-limited reactions in porous media, and approaches used to predict such processes across scales. We focus primarily on the challenges of mixing-driven reactions in porous media at pore scales to provide a concise, but comprehensive picture. We balance our discussion between state-of-the-art experiments, theory and numerical methods, introducing the reader to factors that affect mixing, focusing on the bracketing cases of transverse and longitudinal mixing. We introduce the governing equations for mixing-limited reactions and then summarize several upscaling methods that aim to account for complex pore-scale flow fields. We conclude with perspectives on where the field is going, along with other insights gleaned from this review.\n",

      "abstract Abstract3D printing with powders offers the most analogous method to the natural way in which clastic reservoir rocks are formed, resulting in pore network textures and morphologies similar to natural rocks. To characterize pore networks and their transport properties in rock proxies 3D-printed from powdered materials, solid proxy reservoir rocks were 3D-printed in aluminum, steel, ceramic, and gypsum powders. These proxies were analyzed using traditional destructive and nondestructive reservoir characterization methods. While CT and helium porosimetry helped identify connected porosity, mercury porosimetry provided information on the pore-throat size distribution. X-ray fluorescence was used to identify elemental composition of each material. Thin-section petrography provided further information on proxy pore network microstructure. Despite designing a solid digital model, 3D printers using powder materials can impart significant porosity as a byproduct of the printing process that can be used for repeatable flow and geomechanical experiments in proxies. Ceramic and aluminum proxies showed the lowest porosity. Gypsum proxies had the highest porosity (36%) and range of porosities (5–36%). Metal proxies (aluminum and steel) showed low porosity and minimal mercury intrusion. Proxies were printed in two sizes (8 mm × 15 mm and 25 mm × 25 mm). Larger proxies were lower in porosity except in the case of gypsum because of post-processing artifacts. Ceramic and gypsum proxies showed significant compressibility at high mercury intrusion pressures. Proxies printed in silica sand were the most analogous to natural reservoir rocks despite their high porosity (36–51%) and pore-throat size mode (70 μm).\n",

The moisture and solute transport in the soil are described by the flow and advection–dispersion transport equations.\n",
      "These transport equations are solved by the spectral element method, which is based on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rule and the fully implicit time scheme using the modified Picard iterative procedure constructed with the standard chord slope approximation. The estimation of hydraulic and solute transport parameters has been conducted using the Levenberg–Marquardt method. The goals of the inverse problem were to develop soil hydrochemical characteristics estimation strategies based on combined two of the following functional cost measurements: moisture content, pressure head, hydraulic conductivity, cumulative outflow, and solute concentration. The performance of the inverse algorithm was evaluated using the coefficient of determination, the root-mean-square error, and the relative error analysis which provide an optimal scheme for parameters estimation. The spectral element method was shown to provide good results with negligible error when compared to analytical values. The obtained results indicate excellent agreement of the method for estimating hydraulic and transport parameters with negligible relative error when compared estimated parameters and true values. The choice and the order of combination of objective functions affect crucially the inverse solution especially in case of large hydrochemical parameters estimates.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNano-remediation is a promising in situ remediation technology. It consists in injecting reactive nanoparticles (NPs) into the subsurface for the displacement or the degradation of contaminants. However, due to the poor mobility control of the reactive nanoparticle suspension, the application of nano-remediation has some major challenges, such as high mobility of the particles, which may favor override of the contamination, and particle aggregation, which can lead to a limited distance of influence. Previous experimental studies show the potential of combining nano-remediation with foam flooding to overcome these issues. However, in order to design and optimize the process, a model which couples nanoparticle and foam transport is necessary. In this paper, a mechanistic model to describe the transport of NPs with and by a foam is presented. The model considers the delivery of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and accounts for the processes of aggregation, attachment/detachment, and generation/destruction. Simulations show that when NPs are dispersed in the liquid phase, even in the presence of a foam, they may travel much slower than the NPs carried by the foam bubbles. This is because the nanoparticles in suspension are affected by the attachment onto the rock walls and straining at the pore throats. When the nanoparticle surface is, instead, modified in order to favor their adsorption onto the gas bubbles, NPs are carried by the foam without retardation, except for the small fraction suspended in the liquid phase. Moreover, very stable high-quality foam (\\(f_\\mathrm{g}\\)), i.e., 80–90 vol% of gas, can be attained using properly surface-modified nZVI (i.e., a nanoparticle-stabilized foam), allowing a significant reduction of water for the operation, while increasing the efficiency of nZVI delivery, even in a low-permeability medium within the shallow subsurface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTransport processes such as the dispersion and mixing of solutes are governed by the interplay of advection and diffusion, where advection acts to organise fluid streamlines and diffusion acts to randomise solute molecules. Thus, the structure and organisation of streamlines, termed the Lagrangian kinematics of the flow, is central to the understanding and modelling of these transport processes. A key question is whether the streamlines in three-dimensional (3D) Darcy flows can wander freely through the fluid domain, or whether all streamlines of the flow are organised into a series of smooth, non-intersecting two-dimensional (2D) surfaces. The existence of such a foliation of surfaces constrains the Lagrangian kinematics in a manner similar to that of 2D flows, which in turn constrains the allowable transport processes. In a series of pioneering studies, Sposito (Water Resour. Res., 30(8):2395–2401, 1994; Adv. Water Resour., 24(7):793–801, 2001) argues that steady Darcy flow in locally isotropic media gives rise to Lamb surfaces, 2D material surfaces which are spanned by both the streamlines and vortex lines (field lines of the vorticity vector) of the flow. Hence, the existence of these surfaces renders the kinematics of such 3D steady Darcy flow as two dimensions. This topological constraint strongly affects transverse mixing and dispersion because 2D steady flow fields limit the rate of deformation of fluid elements and can only admit zero hydrodynamic transverse dispersion. In this study, however, we show that Lamb surfaces are not ubiquitous to all steady Darcy flows in locally isotropic media. We derive the conditions for when Lamb surfaces exist in such Darcy flows, and discuss the implications of these findings for the transport, mixing, and dispersion of solutes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe TOUGH+Millstone simulator has been developed for the analysis of coupled flow, thermal and geomechanical processes associated with the formation and/or dissociation of \\(\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\) hydrates in geological media. It is composed of two constituent codes: (a) a significantly enhanced version of the TOUGH+HYDRATE simulator, v2.0, that accounts for all known flow, physical, thermodynamic and chemical processes associated with the behavior of hydrate-bearing systems undergoing changes and includes the most recent advances in the description of the system properties, coupled seamlessly with (b) Millstone v1.0, a new code that addresses the conceptual, computational and mathematical shortcomings of earlier codes used to describe the geomechanical response of these systems. The capabilities of the TOUGH+Millstone code are demonstrated in the simulation and analysis of the system flow, thermal and geomechanical behavior during gas production from a realistic complex offshore hydrate deposit. In the second part of this series, we describe the Millstone geomechanical simulator. The hydrate-dependent, rate-based poromechanical formulation is presented and solved using a finite element discretization. A novel multimesh coupling scheme is introduced, wherein interpolators are automatically built to transfer data between the finite difference discretization of TOUGH+ and the finite element discretization of Millstone. We provide verification examples against analytic solutions for poroelasticity and a simplified demonstration problem for mechanically induced phase change in a hydrate sediment.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSignificant progress has been made in the field of pore-scale imaging in the last decade which is revolutionizing various scientific disciplines, including biology, material science, and food engineering. Pore-scale imaging holds considerable potential for estimating volumetric and hydromechanical properties of rocks for a variety of geoscience applications. However, the micron-scale images, generated by the present imaging technology, are limited in resolution and thus a significant portion of rock pore volume can remain unresolved. We use the established concepts of capillary physics in rocks to infer rock porosity that sits in pores that are smaller than the image voxel without the need for higher resolution imaging that is only possible at the expense of image field of view or physical laboratory measurement. This allows us to estimate porosity of reservoir rocks using X-ray computer tomography even when a significant portion of pore volume is below image resolution. We find that the porosity inferred by our method matches the experimentally obtained total porosity for rocks. The proposed concept is also applicable to other modes of imaging, including thin-section light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron source micro-CT.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe present a general novel technique to monitor saturation changes on small rock samples of only 15 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length for the purpose of assessing the kinetics of spontaneous imbibition processes. With a fully 3D imbibition configuration involving countercurrent flows through all faces of the sample, the method is based on an NMR technique in which the sole oil phase present within the sample is monitored. The experimental method is fast for two reasons that are (1) the possibility to perform accurate measurements on tiny samples and (2) the adoption of a 3D flow geometry. The kinetics of oil desaturation during spontaneous imbibition is analyzed with the help of an analytical 3D diffusion model, according to which the kinetics is proportional to the value of a “capillary” diffusion coefficient. For the purpose of demonstrating our methodology, we used this technique to compare the spontaneous imbibition of restored sandstone miniplugs from a sandstone reservoir, with and without alkali in the imbibing brine. The imbibition kinetics was quantified as capillary diffusion coefficient values. The studied case results revealed mixed impacts of alkali on the spontaneous imbibition kinetics, involving both a brine–oil interfacial tension change and a wettability alteration of the rock, the latter requiring further investigation beyond the scope of this article.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we critique the performance of the node control volume finite element (NCVFE) method for modeling multi-phase fluid flow in heterogeneous media. The NCVFE method solves for the pressure at the vertices of elements and a control volume mesh is constructed around them. Material properties are defined on elements, while transport is simulated on the control volumes. These two meshes are not aligned producing inaccurate results and artificial fluid smearing when modeling multi-phase fluid flow in heterogeneous media. We perform numerical tests to quantify and visualize the extent of this artificial fluid smearing in domains with different material properties. The domains are composed of tetrahedron finite elements. Large artificial fluid smearing is observed in coarse meshes; however, it decreases with the increase in mesh resolution. These findings prompt the use of high-resolution meshes for the method and the need for development of novel numerical methods to address this unphysical flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe stability of natural convection in a vertical layer of heat-generating Darcy porous medium saturated with an Oldroyd-B fluid using a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model has been investigated numerically. The impermeable vertical walls of the porous layer are maintained at different uniform temperatures. As a consequence of LTNE model, two temperature equations representing the fluid and solid phases separately are used for the heat transport equation. A uniform volumetric heating in both fluid and solid phases is considered and the transfer of heat between the phases is considered in the basic state. The internal heating introduced asymmetry in the basic flow which led to the existence of competing modes. The intricacies of internal heat source strength in the fluid and the solid phases are clearly discerned on the stability of the system. The stress relaxation parameter \\(\\Lambda_{1}\\), fluid-heat generation parameter \\(Q_{f}\\), solid-heat generation parameter \\(Q_{s}\\) and the porosity-modified conductivities ratio \\(\\gamma\\) were found to exhibit destabilizing effect on the system, while the strain retardation parameter \\(\\Lambda_{2}\\) shows an opposite trend even in the presence of internal heating.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe extend previous analyses of the origins of complex transport dynamics in compressible porous media to the case where the input transient signal at a boundary is generated by a multimodal spectrum. By adding harmonic and anharmonic modal frequencies as perturbations to a fundamental mode, we examine how such multimodal signals affect the Lagrangian complexity of flow in compressible porous media. While the results apply to all poroelastic media (industrial, biological and geophysical), for concreteness we couch the discussion in terms of unpumped coastal groundwater systems having a discharge boundary forced by tides. Particular local regions of the conductivity field generate saddles that hold up and braid (mix) trajectories, resulting in unexpected behaviours of groundwater residence time distributions and topological mixing manifolds near the tidal boundary. While increasing spectral complexity can reduce the occurrence of periodic points, especially for anharmonic spectra with long characteristic periods, other signatures of Lagrangian complexity persist. The action of natural multimodal tidal signals on confined groundwater flow in heterogeneous aquifers can induce exotic flow topologies and mixing effects that are profoundly different to conventional concepts of groundwater discharge processes. Taken together, our results imply that increasing spectral complexity results in more complex Lagrangian structure in flows through compressible porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractExchange processes between a turbulent free flow and a porous media flow are sensitive to the flow dynamics in both flow regimes, as well as to the interface that separates them. Resolving these complex exchange processes across irregular interfaces is key in understanding many natural and engineered systems. With soil–water evaporation as the natural application of interest, the coupled behavior and exchange between flow regimes are investigated numerically, considering a turbulent free flow as well as interfacial forms and obstacles. Interfacial forms and obstacles will alter the flow conditions at the interface, creating flow structures that either enhance or reduce exchange rates based on their velocity conditions and their mixing with the main flow. To evaluate how these interfacial forms change the exchange rates, interfacial conditions are isolated and investigated numerically. First, different flow speeds are compared for a flat surface. Second, a porous obstacle of varied height is introduced at the interface, and the effects the flow structures that develop have on the interface are analyzed. The flow parameters of this obstacle are then varied and the interfacial exchange rates investigated. Next, to evaluate the interaction of flow structures between obstacles, a second obstacle is introduced, separated by a varied distance. Finally, the shape of these obstacles is modified to create different wave forms. Each of these interfacial forms and obstacles is shown to create different flow structures adjacent to the surface which alter the mass, momentum, and energy conditions at the interface. These changes will enhance the exchange rate in locations where higher velocity gradients and more mixing with the main flow develop, but will reduce the exchange rate in locations where low velocity gradients and limited mixing with the main flow occur.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTurbulence transportation across permeable interfaces is investigated using direct numerical simulation, and the connection between the turbulent surface flow and the pore flow is explored. The porous media domain is constructed with an in-line arranged circular cylinder array. The effects of Reynolds number and porosity are also investigated by comparing cases with two Reynolds numbers (\\(Re\\approx 3000,6000\\)) and two porosities (\\(\\varphi =0.5,0.8\\)). It was found that the change of porosity leads to the variation of flow motions near the interface region, which further affect turbulence transportation below the interface. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows that turbulent diffusion and pressure transportation work as energy sink and source alternatively, which suggests a possible route for turbulence transferring into porous region. Further analysis on the spectral TKE budget reveals the role of modes of different wavelengths. A major finding is that mean convection not only affects the distribution of TKE in spatial space, but also in scale space. The permeability of the wall also have an major impact on the occurrence ratio between blow and suction events as well as their corresponding flow structures, which can be related to the change of the Kármán constant of the mean velocity profile.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEstimating flow and transport properties of porous media that undergo deformation as a result of applying an external pressure or force is important to a wide variety of processes, ranging from injecting a fracking liquid into shale formations, to CO\\(_2\\) sequestration in spent oil reservoirs. We propose a novel model for estimating the effective flow and transport properties of such porous media. Assuming that the solid matrix of a porous medium undergoes elastic deformation, and given its initial porosity before deformation, as well as the Young’s modulus of its grains, the model uses an extension of the Hertz–Mindlin theory of contact between grains to compute the new PSD that results from applying an external pressure P to the medium, and utilizes the updated PSD in the effective-medium approximation (EMA) to estimate the effective flow and transport properties at pressure P. In the present part of this series, we use the theory to predict the effective permeability as a function of the applied pressure. Comparison between the predictions and experimental data for twenty-four types of sandstones indicates excellent agreement between the two.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Geometric straining of particles in porous media is of critical importance in a broad range of natural and industrial settings, such as contaminant transport in aquifers and the permeability decline due to pore plugging in oil reservoirs. Pore network modeling is a computationally efficient approach to simulate transport problems in porous media that has been used to simulate particle deposition and size exclusion. However, existing network models are unable to simulate particle jamming due to the simplification of geometry and the lack of capability for simulating particle–particle interactions. Here, we develop a novel pore network model for particle jamming in porous media. The jamming in pore throats is predicted by the probability of jamming, which is a function of pore/particle size ratio, particle concentration, and coefficient of friction (COF). A unified probability model is developed based on Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of particle jamming in porous media consisting of a single layer of spherical grains. The geometry is based on two packing extremes, those with grains arranged in a triangle and a square. The model is then implemented into the pore network model to predict jamming in porous media. This framework combines the efficiency of network modeling and the accuracy of direct simulations on particle jamming. We verify the model against CFD-DEM simulations. The results of network simulations show that the probability of jamming increases with COF. At low particle concentrations (C = 5%), the probability of jamming for large pore throats is small. There is a critical particle concentration (C = 9%) when the grain/particle size ratio is 10, above which jamming is self-reinforcing and the inlet face of the porous medium will be completely blocked (C = 11%). The effect of velocity on the probability of jamming is insignificant compared with the effects of particle concentration and pore/particle size ratio. Article Highlights We propose a novel pore network model for particle jamming based on the probability. The pore network model has a higher computational efficiency, compared with other numerical models, such as CFD-DEM model. The pore network model can accurately predict the permeability changes of porous media during the jamming process.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTemperature warmback analysis has been recently adopted to quantitatively infer the injection profile during injection of cold fluids in stratified and heterogeneous reservoirs. The rate of temperature recovery during a pause of the injection operation is sensitive to the injection profile. In this work, different analytical solutions are presented to model the transient temperature in the reservoir during the injection and the following shut-in periods considering variable injection rate and variable injection temperature conditions. The solutions are further extended to consider the thermal storage capacity of the wellbore as well as the thermal resistances of wellbore components that separate the temperature measurement tool from the sandface. Different inversion procedures are presented accordingly to infer the injection profile using the measured temperature history during the injection and the shut-in periods. Inversion procedures using optimization routines and/or graphical techniques are presented. The graphical techniques are valid for an extended shut-in time, while the regression analysis using optimization tools is applicable for any shut-in durations. Different synthetic cases are presented using a thermal compositional reservoir simulator to show the validity of the fully analytical and semi-analytical models developed in this work. The inversion approach is further applied to published field data for water injection operation in a stratified reservoir. The estimated injection profile is in close agreement with the reported results obtained using a numerical simulation tool.\n",

      "abstract AbstractRealizable CO2 storage potential for saline formations without closed lateral boundaries depends on the combined effects of physical and chemical trapping mechanisms to prevent long-term migration out of the defined storage area. One such mechanism is the topography of the caprock surface, which may retain CO2 in structural pockets along the migration path. Past theoretical and modeling studies suggest that even traps too small to be accurately described by seismic data may play a significant role. In this study, we use real but scarce seismic data from the Gassum Formation of the Norwegian Continental shelf to estimate the impact of topographical features of the top seal in limiting CO2 migration. We seek to estimate the amount of macro- and sub-scale trapping potential of the formation based on a few dozen interpreted 2D seismic lines and identified faults. We generate multiple high-resolution realizations of the top surface, constructed to be faithful to both large-scale topography and small-scale statistical properties. The structural trapping and plume retardation potential of these top surfaces is subsequently estimated using spill-point (static) analysis and dynamical flow simulation. By applying these techniques on a large ensemble of top surface realizations generated using a combination of stochastic realizations and systematic variation of key model parameters, we explore the range of possible impacts on plume advancement, physical trapping and migration direction. The stochastic analysis of trapping capacity and retardation efficiency in statistically generated, sub-seismic resolution features may also be applied for surfaces generated from 3D data.\n",

      "abstract AbstractOur study is keyed to the development of a viable framework for the stochastic characterization of coreflooding simulation models under two- and three-phase flow conditions taking place within a core sample in the presence of preferential flow of the kind that can be associated with the presence of a system of fractures. We do so considering various modeling strategies based on (spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous) single- and dual-continuum formulations of black-oil computational models and relying on a global sensitivity-driven stochastic parameter calibration. The latter is constrained through a set of data collected under a water alternating gas scenario implemented in laboratory-scale coreflooding experiments. We set up a collection of Monte Carlo (MC) numerical simulations while considering uncertainty encompassing (a) rock attributes (i.e., porosity and absolute permeability), as well as (b) fluid–fluid/ fluid–solid interactions, as reflected through characteristic parameters of relative permeability and capillary pressure formulations. Modern moment-based global sensitivity indices are evaluated on the basis of the MC model responses, with the aim of (i) quantifying sensitivity of the coreflooding simulation results to variations of the input uncertain model parameters and (ii) assessing the possibility of reducing the dimensionality of model parameter spaces. We then rest on a stochastic inverse modeling approach grounded on the acceptance–rejection sampling (ARS) algorithm to obtain probability distributions of the key model parameters (as identified through our global sensitivity analyses) conditional to the available experimental observations. The relative skill of the various candidate models to represent the system behavior is quantified upon relying on the deviance information criterion. Our findings reveal that amongst all tested models, a dual-continuum formulation provides the best performance considering the experimental observations available. Only a few of the parameters embedded in the dual-continuum formulation are identified as major elements significantly affecting the prediction (and associated uncertainty) of model outputs, petrophysical attributes and relative permeability model parameters having a stronger effect than parameters related to capillary pressure.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIt is well-known that the presence of geometry heterogeneity in porous media enhances solute mass mixing due to fluid velocity heterogeneity. However, laboratory measurements are still sparse on characterization of the role of high-permeability inclusions on solute transport, in particularly concerning fractured porous media. In this study, the transport of solutes is quantified after a pulse-like injection of soluble fluorescent dye into a 3D-printed fractured porous medium with distinct high-permeability (H-k) inclusions. The solute concentration and the pore-scale fluid velocity are determined using laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry techniques. The migration of solute is delineated with its breakthrough curve (BC), temporal and spatial moments, and mixing metrics (including the scalar dissipation rate, the volumetric dilution index, and the flux-related dilution index) in different regions of the medium. With the same H-k inclusions, compared to a H-k matrix, the low-permeability (L-k) matrix displays a higher peak in its BC, less solute mass retention, a higher peak solute velocity, a smaller peak dispersion coefficient, a lower mixing rate, and a smaller pore volume being occupied by the solute. The flux-related dilution index clearly captures the striated solute plume tails following the streamlines along dead-end fractures and along the interface between the H-k and L-k matrices. We propose a normalization of the scalar dissipation rate and the volumetric dilution index with respect to the maximum regional total solute mass, which offers a generalized examination of solute mixing for an open region with a varying total solute mass. Our study presents insights into the interplay between the geometric features of the fractured porous medium and the solute transport behaviors at the pore scale.\n",

The present study addresses the modeling of SRWC with particular attention paid to hysteresis effects of water filling and draining the pores attributed to ink-bottle effects. For that purpose, an idealized pore size distribution previously developed for predicting water sorption isotherms on cementitious materials, and which can consider the double porosity structure of soils, is used. The input data of the model are assessed only from mercury intrusion porosimetry tests (MIP) and from grain size distribution (GSD). The hysteretic behavior of SRWC is reproduced in a satisfactory way. The model can also predict the specific surface area.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe columns commonly used for the species separation of a binary fluid are very thin vertical parallelepipedic columns, filled with a porous medium (i.e. TGC columns). This species separation is due to the mass flux induces by the thermal gradient applied on walls of the cavity, namely the Soret effect, in the gravity field. In this paper, a new configuration used to study the species separation in a binary fluid was presented. The evolution of species separation in a binary fluid saturating a porous media, in a cavity between two concentric spheres, was studied analytically and numerically. The thickness of the cavity is \\(e=R_o-R_i\\), where \\(R_i\\) and \\(R_o\\) are the internal and external radii, respectively. First, an analytical solution was developed using the parallel flow approximation considering \\(e\\ll R_i\\). The analytical results obtained are in a good agreement with the numerical ones performed with a spectral method or Comsol Multiphysics software. Thus, the results in the spherical configuration were compared with those obtained in a porous TGC column of same thickness, e, height, \\(H=\\pi R_i,\\) and depth, \\(L=2R_o\\).The numerical and analytical studies showed that the differences in mass fractions, \\(C_{\\max }-C_{\\min }\\), and the time needed to obtain the stationary separation starting from a homogeneous binary solution were almost equal in the two configurations. The amount of species separated is greater in the spherical configuration than in the vertical column used.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe proposed study is an attempt to perceive theoretically the heat transfer phenomenon in the flow of temperature-dependent viscous blood through microvessels internally surrounded by a thin layer of endothelial glycocalyx at the wall. While flowing through microvessels, the blood separates into erythrocytes suspended fluid and cell-depleted fluid into core and peripheral regions respectively. Therefore, to best represent the flow of human blood in microvessels, it has been modeled as a two-fluid. Erythrocytes appearing in the core stimulates the non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid is manifested here by Herschel-Bulkley fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity. The plasma surrounded over the blood cells in the peripheral layer is expressed as a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity. An added advantage of utilizing the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation to govern the flow through the layer of endothelial glycocalyx (EGL) is that it is credible for both small and large Darcy numbers (permeability). Linear approximation of the Reynolds, viscosity model is exercised to obtain the analytical solutions for the governing equations of Herschel-Bulkley fluid flowing through the core region. In the non-porous peripheral region, the analytical solutions have been obtained for Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity directly and in the porous peripheral region, the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation is solved using regular perturbation for large Darcy number and singular perturbation with a matched asymptotic condition for small Darcy number. Analytical expressions for the velocity, flow rate, flow impedance, and temperature field have been obtained for the different regions. Graphical analysis revealing significant results regarding the variable viscosity, thermal conductivity, Grashof number, Forchheimer number, Richardson number, and permeability on the hemodynamical variables are conducted and results are discussed in detail. The study concludes that an EGL adjacent to the vessel wall increase the resistance to blood flow. The notable discovery of the study is that the temperature parameters influence all the quantities and therefore establish that the temperature-dependent viscosity plays a vital role in medical treatments involving temperature variation such as chemotherapy.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe stability of natural convection in an internally heated vertical porous layer confined between two impermeable boundaries which are kept at different constant temperatures is investigated. The momentum transfer is modeled by adopting Darcy’s law including time-dependent velocity term contribution. The conduction stream function and temperature fields are significantly altered due to internal heating, and the linear instability is analyzed through a study of normal mode perturbations on the base flow. The neutral stability curves and the critical Darcy–Rayleigh number for the onset of instability are evaluated by solving the stability eigenvalue problem numerically. It has been established that a uniform volumetric heat source and the Prandtl–Darcy number reinforce together in initiating the instability of the base flow under certain conditions despite their isolation presence evidences stability for all infinitesimal perturbations. Although the internal heat source strength is to hasten the onset of instability, and the Prandtl–Darcy number is found to induct both destabilizing and stabilizing impact on the base flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCarbon capture and storage is one of the key technologies that can help industries limit their environmental footprint and societies achieve the climate change mitigation goals. The process entails capturing CO\\(_2\\) and injecting it into deep geological formations for permanent storage. However, the design and modeling of carbon sequestration projects entail significant challenges in assessing the risks and long-term consequences. The fate of CO\\(_2\\) in the subsurface is dictated by many processes including solute transport, multiphase compositional effects, and trapping mechanisms. The ability to properly capture these phenomena is limited by the abstraction of numerical models, the uncertainty in petrophysical characterization, and the modeling of the thermodynamic effects. In this work, we study the impact of each of these factors on the fate of CO\\(_2\\) injection in a meter-scale experimental setup. We model the evolution of the CO\\(_2\\) plume inside the tank using the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We then present an ensemble-based approach to quantify the uncertainties and study the predictability of the numerical models. The results emphasize the ability of the reservoir simulator to predict the evolution of CO\\(_2\\) in the FluidFlower experimental setup. They also highlight the importance of considering the uncertainty in experimental testing of petrophysical properties in the risk assessment of geological carbon storage projects.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWettability is one of the critical parameters affecting multiphase flow in porous media. The wettability is determined by the affinity of fluids to the rock surface, which varies due to factors such as mineral heterogeneity, roughness, ageing, and pore-space geometry. It is well known that wettability varies spatially in natural rocks, and it is still generally considered a constant parameter in pore-scale simulation studies. The accuracy of pore-scale simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is undermined by such inadequate wettability models. The advent of in situ visualization techniques, e.g. X-ray imaging and microtomography, enables us to characterize the spatial distribution of wetting more accurately. There are several approaches for such characterization. Most include the construction of a meshed surface of the interface surfaces in a segmented X-ray image and are known to have significant errors arising from insufficient resolution and surface-smoothing algorithms. This work presents a novel approach for spatial determination of wetting properties using local lattice-Boltzmann simulations. The scheme is computationally efficient as the segmented X-ray image is divided into subdomains before conducting the lattice-Boltzmann simulations, enabling fast simulations. To test the proposed method, it was applied to two synthetic cases with known wettability and three datasets of imaged fluid distributions. The wettability map was obtained for all samples using local lattice-Boltzmann calculations on trapped ganglia and optimization on surface affinity parameters. The results were quantitatively compared with a previously developed geometrical contact angle determination method. The two synthetic cases were used to validate the results of the developed workflow, as well as to compare the wettability results with the geometrical analysis method. It is shown that the developed workflow accurately characterizes the wetting state in the synthetic porous media with an acceptable uncertainty and is better to capture extreme wetting conditions. For the three datasets of imaged fluid distributions, our results show that the obtained contact angle distributions are consistent with the geometrical method. However, the obtained contact angle distributions tend to have a narrower span and are considered more realistic compared to the geometrical method. Finally, our results show the potential of the proposed scheme to efficiently obtain wettability maps of porous media using X-ray images of multiphase fluid distributions. The developed workflow can help for more accurate characterization of the wettability map in the porous media using limited experimental data, and hence more accurate digital rock analysis of multiphase flow in porous media.\n",

Under the conditions of our experiments, we observe that precipitation reaction along the moving fluid–fluid interface generates solids in the form of mineral particle suspensions. We find that both electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces control the extent of particle–particle agglomeration during the suspension flow. Such particle suspension decreases the overall mobility of the multiphase mixture, thus altering the overall displacement. Although the injected fluids are viscously stable, the precipitation band that forms between the fluids becomes unstable to form finger-like flow channels compartmentalized by solid-deposited walls and clusters. We show that the emergence, growth and decay of the fingering pattern are strongly influenced by the injection rate and the initial fluid chemical concentrations. In addition, we show that precipitation-induced fingering has a strong feedback on fluid–fluid mixing and the subsequent precipitation rate. Lastly, we find that, counter to intuition, a higher injection rate results in a larger amount of precipitates that are securely deposited in the Hele–Shaw cell.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAdditive manufacturing (AM) allows the production of the internal structure of porous media (PM) with porosity and permeability tailored for a specific application. Material extrusion (MEX) AM enables the fabrication of a lattice-type porous structure by varying process parameters, usually applying the zigzag raster filling strategy. In a recent study, a Variable Bead Width Porous Filling (VBWPF) strategy was proposed, which generates pores by changing the printing speed during filament deposition and resulting in a unique porous structure with less pore interconnectivity. Specific pores’ dimensions and distribution on the layer can be obtained with the strategy’s parameters. In this work, different configurations of the VBWPF strategy were produced, and their porosity and permeability were measured experimentally. A PM with traditional raster filling (lattice structure) was also printed and measured for comparison. The porous structures of different VBWPF configurations were analyzed with micro-computed tomography (µCT). The results showed that VBWPF parameters were able to modify the porous structure obtained, changing the porosity and permeability of the PM. The PM produced exhibited 27% lower porosity and 55% lower permeability than the traditional raster filling PM with similar pore widths. These unique characteristics open up the field for applications of PM obtained through AM.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe impact of wettability on the co-moving velocity of two-fluid flow in porous media is analyzed herein. The co-moving velocity, developed by Roy et al. (Front Phys 8:4, 2022), is a novel representation of the flow behavior of two fluids through porous media. Our study aims to better understand the behavior of the co-moving velocity by analyzing simulation data under various wetting conditions. We analyzed 46 relative permeability curves based on the Lattice–Boltzmann color fluid model and two experimentally determined relative permeability curves. The analysis of the relative permeability data followed the methodology proposed by Roy et al. (Front Phys 8:4, 2022) to reconstruct a constitutive equation for the co-moving velocity. Surprisingly, the coefficients of the constitutive equation were found to be nearly the same for all wetting conditions. On the basis of these results, a simple approach was proposed to reconstruct the relative permeability of the oil phase using only the co-moving velocity relationship and the relative permeability of the water phase. This proposed method provides new information on the interdependence of the relative permeability curves, which has implications for the history matching of production data and the solution of the associated inverse problem. The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of wettability on fluid flow in porous media and provide a practical approach for estimating relative permeability based on the co-moving velocity relationship, which has never been shown before.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe fluid flow dynamics on the porous scaffolds and their static responses on the adjacent bone are very crucial parameters for bone adaptation. Researchers are trying to develop different algorithms to design biomimetic porous scaffolds incorporating bone tissue engineering. In this present work, three types of biomimetic heterogeneous porous scaffolds (HPS) were designed with the help of the Voronoi tessellation method and Swarm Intelligence and those were analysed under fluid perfusion as well as under static loading conditions. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, the wall shear stress (WSS) and the permeability of the porous scaffolds were compared to the natural trabecular bone to understand their hydrodynamic responses. In static analysis, the von Mises stresses of the Ti6Al4V scaffolds were checked to ensure no-yield condition. The strain energy density (SED) distributions were also studied on the neighbouring bone region of the femur greater trochanter to obtain stress shielding (SS) patterns and these findings were then compared with the natural trabecular bone at the same anatomical region. The outcome parameters, viz. the induced WSS, von Mises stress, the permeability, and SS of the scaffold, are found to be independent of the scaffold architecture. The von Mises stress and permeability increased with an increase in porosities, while the induced WSS and SS nature of the scaffolds showed the reverse trend. The results showed that the HPS designed based on the Swarm Intelligence incorporating Physarum Polycephalum algorithm offered the least SS level of 41.096 for 75% porous HPS, which may be considered the most promising result. Considering all the parameters, the novel designed scaffold based on Swarm Intelligence showed the most trabecular bone mimicking nature compared to the other scaffolds.\n",

      "abstract AbstractQuantifying the relationship between geometric descriptors of microstructure and effective properties like permeability is essential for understanding and improving the behavior of porous materials. In this paper, we employ a previously developed stochastic model to investigate microstructure–property relationships of nonwovens. First, we show the capability of the model to generate a wide variety of realistic nonwovens by varying the model parameters. By computing various geometric descriptors, we investigate the relationship between model parameters and microstructure morphology and, in this way, assess the range of structures which may be described by our model. In a second step, we perform virtual materials testing based on the simulation of a wide range of nonwovens. For these 3D structures, we compute geometric descriptors and perform numerical simulations to obtain values for permeability as an effective material property. We then examine and quantify the relationship between microstructure morphology and permeability by fitting parametric regression formulas to the obtained data set, including but not limited to formulas from the literature. We show that for structures which are captured by our model, predictive power may be improved by allowing for slightly more complex formulas.\n",

      "abstract AbstractColloidal transport and clogging in porous media is a phenomenon of critical importance in many branches of applied sciences and engineering. It involves multiple types of interactions that span from the sub-colloid scale (electrochemical interactions) up to the pore-scale (bridging), thus challenging the development of representative modelling. So far published simulation results of colloidal or particulate transport are based on either reduced set of forces or spatial dimensions. Here we present an approach enabling to overcome both computational and physical limitations posed by a problem of 3D colloidal transport in porous media. An adaptive octree mesh is introduced to a coupled CFD and DEM method while enabling tracking of individual colloids. Flow fields are calculated at a coarser scale throughout the domain, and at fine-scale around colloids. The approach accounts for all major interactions in such a system: elastic, electrostatic, and hydrodynamic forces acting between colloids, as well as colloids and the collector surface. The method is demonstrated for a single throat model made of four spherical segments, and the impact of clogging is reported in terms of the evolution of the critical path diameter for percolation and permeability. We identified four stages of clogging development depending on position and time of individual colloid entrapment, which in turn correlates to a cluster evolution and local transport.\n",

In particular, a generalised anomalous diffusion model departing from the classical Fickian diffusion and accounting for subdiffusion or superdiffusion phenomena is employed. At the porous layer boundaries, a uniform vertical concentration gradient is imposed, so that an unstable density stratification arises. The boundaries are modelled as open, meaning that uniform pressure conditions are prescribed. A linear stability analysis of the basic rest state is carried out, showing how the departure from the classical Fickian diffusion affects dramatically the conditions for the onset of the instability.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe linear stability analysis of Darcy–Brinkman–Bénard convection (DBBC) in a binary fluid-saturated porous layer is studied numerically using \\(n\\) term Galerkin approach for rigid–rigid, isothermal boundaries. The occupied binary fluid and porous medium are assumed to be in thermal non-equilibrium. Thus, two energy equations are used for each phase. The critical values of the Darcy–Rayleigh and wave numbers for the onset of convection are obtained by considering ten terms in the Galerkin solution. The effect of the five parameters of the model, namely the Darcy number, Da, the modified ratio of thermal conductivity \\(\\gamma\\), the Lewis number Le, the separation ratio coefficient, \\(\\chi\\), and the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, H, on the stability of the system is discussed in detail and presented with the aid of plots and tables. The onset of convection in a binary fluid-saturated porous medium is delayed for realistic boundary conditions compared with ideal boundary conditions (stress-free, isothermal boundary conditions). Increasing the values of the Darcy number, inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, and the separation ratio coefficient stabilizes DBBC. In contrast, the thermal conductivity ratio and Lewis number are destabilize the system. Furthermore, convective cell size remains unaltered with increasing \\(\\chi\\). Convection is delayed in the pure fluid medium compared to the binary fluid medium. Local thermal non-equilibrium ceases for small and large inter-phase heat transfer coefficient values.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany subsurface formations, such as soils, carbonate rocks, and mudstones, possess multiscale pore structures that impose significant challenges to the pore-scale modeling of flow and transport processes. Despite the development of several models, there is a lack of comparative studies and quantitative analysis to evaluate their performance. In this work, we present two image-based hybrid models for predicting absolute permeability and electrical formation factor: a dual-pore-network model (DPNM) and a pore-network-continuum model (PNCM). We use several publicly available digital rock samples of Estaillades carbonate, one of which includes experimentally characterized sub-resolution regions (i.e., microporosity) represented by 3D maps of porosity and entry pressure. We perform comprehensive comparisons between the DPNM and PNCM, focusing on the strengths and limitations of the DPNM. Our results show that, assuming homogeneous microporosity, both the DPNM and PNCM accurately predict absolute permeability and formation factors. However, for realistic heterogeneous microporosity, the DPNM significantly underestimates absolute permeability by more than an order of magnitude, compared to the PNCM. We also explore two methods to improve the performance of our DPNM. Our findings will provide a foundation for the application of DPNMs to a wide range of geological and engineering systems.\n",

This study presents a novel approach for multispecies contaminants transport in heterogeneous porous media that is founded on the temporally relaxed theory of Fick’s Law. The methodology introduces two relaxation times to account for solute particle collisions and attachment, leading to the derivation of new coupled ADEs. The semi-analytical solution is obtained in the Laplace domain after a linear transformation of Clement to address the mathematical complexity of the problem. The model’s simulation results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical models and existing analytical solutions for multispecies contaminants transport in Fickian and non-Fickian transport concepts. Results obtained demonstrated that the effects of time lagging of the temporal and spatial distribution of each species of the decay chain depend on the retardation factor, decay constant as well as input distribution of each member. Additionally, the temporal relaxed theory can quickly assess the risks incurred by drinking groundwater contaminated by radionuclides as shown in the application to \\({}^{238}{\\text{Pu}}\\) the decay chain in a waste deposition site. This innovative approach provides an in-depth understanding of the transport of contaminants from multiple species and its impact on groundwater contamination. The temporal relaxed theory seems promising for more accurately estimating the risks associated with decay chains, such as radionuclides.\n",

      "abstract AbstractGreen’s functions for two-point liquid sources analyze anisotropic mechanical-fluid interactions, providing insights for real-world applications and enabling precision in design optimization across geomechanics and biomechanics. In this paper, we uniquely derive the expression for a two-point fluid source influenced by poroelasticity in an infinite transversely isotropic material, providing a novel contribution to the literature. Initially, we obtain the general solution for the governing equations using the potential theory method with Almansi’s theorem. Subsequently, building on the general solution, we derive a fundamental solution for a two-point fluid source using harmonic functions with undetermined constants. These constants are determined through continuous and equilibrium conditions. The resulting exact solutions serve as benchmarks for numerical codes and approximate solutions, offering crucial support for a wide range of project problems. To provide further insight, we present complex numerical examples illustrating the physical mechanisms through contours. Results show symmetry around two-point fluid sources, with higher magnitudes and sign changes indicating compression and expansion zones. Zero contours and inflection points are identified, while coupling effects diminish in the far field and become singular at the sources, providing valuable insights into their spatial extent and intensity. To validate our results, we compare them with existing literature, enhancing the credibility of our approach and contributing to the ongoing dialog in the field.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe investigate the upscaling of diffusive transport parameters using a stochastic framework. At sub-REV (representative elementary volume) scale, the complexity of the pore space geometry leads to a significant scatter of the observed diffusive transport. We study a large set of volumes reconstructed from focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy data. Each individual volume provides us sub-REV measurements on porosity and the so-called transport-ability, being a dimensionless parameter representing the ratio of diffusive flux through the porous volume to that through an empty volume. The detected scatter of the transport-ability is mathematically characterized through a probability distribution function (PDF) with a mean and variance as function of porosity, which includes implicitly the effect of pore structure differences among sub-REV volumes. We then investigate domain size effects and predict when REV scale is reached. While the scatter in porosity observations decreases linearly with increasing sample size as expected, the observed scatter in transport-ability does not converge to zero. Our results confirm that differences in pore structure impact transport parameters at all scales. Consequently, the use of PDFs to describe the relationship of effective transport coefficients to porosity is advantageous to deterministic semiempirical functions. We discuss the consequences and advocate the use of PDFs for effective parameters in both continuum equations and data interpretation of experimental or computational work. The presented statistics-based upscaling technique of sub-REV microscopy data provides a new tool in understanding, describing and predicting macroscopic transport behavior of microporous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSolute transport in unsaturated conditions is important in various applications and natural environments, such as groundwater flow in the vadose zone. Studies of unsaturated solute transport show complex characteristics (e.g. non-Fickian transport) due to larger variations in the pore-scale velocities compared to transport in saturated conditions. However, the physical processes at the pore scale are still not completely understood because direct three-dimensional observations at the pore scale are very limited. In this study, single-phase and two-phase solute transport was directly characterized by performing tracer injection experiments in a sintered glass and Bentheimer sandstone sample. These experiments were imaged by continuous scanning with fast laboratory-based micro-computed tomography. The network-scale flow velocities and transport properties were characterized by using the pore-based transient concentration fields to determine the tracer’s arrival time and filling duration in every pore. Important measures for dispersion (the scalar dissipation rate and filling duration) were determined and indicated a wide range in pore-scale velocities and the existence of stagnant and flowing pores for the unsaturated experiments. Furthermore, we performed the first quantification of the mass transfer coefficient between stagnant and flowing pores on three-dimensional experimental data. We also calculated the tortuosity directly from the interstitial velocity and the pore-based velocity. This was found to be 13% higher in unsaturated conditions compared to saturated conditions. Our results indicate that pore-scale structural heterogeneity increases the differences between saturated and unsaturated solute transport. This study thus provides further insight into pore-scale spreading and mixing of dissolved substances in unsaturated porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThis study presents an automated method for objectively measuring rock heterogeneity via raw X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods, which are time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Unlike approaches that rely on image segmentation, the proposed method processes micro-CT images directly, identifying textural heterogeneity. The image is partitioned into subvolumes, where attributes are calculated for each one, with entropy serving as a measure of uncertainty. This method adapts to varying sample characteristics and enables meaningful comparisons across distinct sets of samples. It was applied to a dataset consisting of 4935 images of cylindrical plug samples derived from Brazilian reservoirs. The results showed that the selected attributes play a key role in producing desirable outcomes, such as strong correlations with structural heterogeneity. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we used evaluations provided by four experts who classified 175 samples as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, where each expert assessed a different number of samples. One of the presented attributes demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous samples labelled by all the experts, whereas the other two attributes yielded nonsignificant differences for three out of the four experts. The method was shown to better align with the expert choices than traditional textural attributes known for extracting heterogeneous properties from images. This textural heterogeneity measure provides an additional parameter that can assist in rock characterization, and the automated approach ensures easy reproduction and high cost-effectiveness.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used to find fluid type and pore size distribution in rocks. Low-field NMR employs Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill pulse sequences to measure reservoir rock properties, where echo signals are inverted to determine T2 relaxation times. Further analysis provides petrophysical parameters and fluid classification. However, noise and the ill-posed nature of inversion lead to low-resolution T2 spectra, complicating fluid quantification. This study introduces LMsNN, a lightweight multi-scale neural network, to enhance the accuracy of T2 spectrum inversion. By incorporating physical response equations and constraints, LMsNN reduces artifacts and enhances optimization robustness. We validate the method using numerical simulations and direct rock sample measurements, comparing it with two traditional inversion techniques. Results show that LMsNN effectively processes low signal-to-noise ratio, improving fluid identification across rock types. We further applied LMsNN to NMR well log data, where the porosity derived from the inverted T2 spectra closely matched direct rock sample measurements. These findings demonstrate that LMsNN significantly improves NMR relaxation spectrum resolution, offering a more reliable and robust approach for fluid characterization.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEnzymatically induced calcium carbonate precipitation is a promising geotechnique with the potential, for example, to seal leakage pathways in the subsurface or to stabilize soils. Precipitation of calcium carbonate in a porous medium reduces the porosity and, consequently, the permeability. With pseudo-2D microfluidic experiments, including pressure monitoring and, for visualization, optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography, pore-space alterations were reliably related to corresponding hydraulic responses. The study comprises six experiments with two different pore structures, a simple, quasi-1D structure, and a 2D structure. Using a continuous injection strategy with either constant or step-wise reduced flow rates, we identified key mechanisms that significantly influence the relationship between porosity and permeability. In the quasi-1D structure, the location of precipitates is more relevant to the hydraulic response (pressure gradients) than the overall porosity change. In the quasi-2D structure, this is different, because flow can bypass locally clogged regions, thus leading to steadier porosity–permeability relationships. Moreover, in quasi-2D systems, during continuous injection, preferential flow paths can evolve and remain open. Classical porosity–permeability power-law relationships with constant exponents cannot adequately describe this phenomenon. We furthermore observed coexistence and transformation of different polymorphs of calcium carbonate, namely amorphous calcium carbonate, vaterite, and calcite and discuss their influence on the observed development of preferential flow paths. This has so far not been accounted for in the state-of-the-art approaches for porosity–permeability relationships during calcium carbonate precipitation in porous media.\n",

      "abstract Abstarct Despite a broad application of ureolytic bacteria in many bioremediation and biocementation processes, very limited studies have reported their transport and retention behaviors under various physical–chemical–biological conditions. In this study, we report transport and retention of Sporosarcina pasteurii in saturated sand, based on a series of column breakthrough experiments under different conditions including ionic strengths (ISs: 0.5 mM–1 M), flow velocity (50, 100, 200 cm/h), bacteria optical density (OD600 = 1.0, 0.48), column length (280 mm, 150 mm), and changes in IS conditions (0.5 M CaCl2 or deionised water). We use a two-site kinetic model, representing (1) attachment on grain surfaces, and (2) straining at crevices and constrictions, to quantify and predict the bacterial attachment and straining. Model parameters were calibrated by tracer (NaCl) breakthrough curves (BTCs) and bacteria BTCs at different IS/velocity conditions. The model was then applied to successfully predict the bacteria BTCs at lower initial bacteria density (OD600 = 0.48) and for shorter column lengths (150 mm). We demonstrated that higher ionic strength (from 0.5 to 1000 mM) dramatically enhanced the retention efficiency of S. pasteurii through an enhancement of attachment (from 9.4 to 69.6%) and straining (from 8.1 to 34.2%), whilst the bacterial survival and the urease activity were unaffected at high IS conditions (500 and 1000 mM NaCl) within 5 h. Increasing flow velocity (from 50 to 200 cm/h) caused a decrease in attachment (from 39.5 to 22.4%) and decrease in straining (from 40.5 to 19.3%) as a result of the increased hydrodynamic shear forces, which tends to reduce the attachment at the secondary minimum and decrease the extent of flow stagnation regions for straining. Lower initial bacteria OD600 (from 1.0 to 0.48) enhanced the attachment (from 31.8 to 40.9%) and the straining (from 22.9 to 42.2%) as a result of reducing the site-blockage effect. In addition, 0.5 M CaCl2 with a stronger IS increased the retention of in the column, whilst deionised water with a lower IS caused bacterial release. These findings provide useful information for a better understanding of the transport and fate of Sporosarcina pasteurii in saturated soil, and can be used to optimise bioaugmentation strategy and cementation efficiency for soil improvement. Article Highlights Transport of S. pasteurii in sands is highly affected by ionic strength, flow velocity, bacteria density, and even column size Straining was enhanced (from 8.1% to 34.2%) if increasing IS (from 0.5 to 500 mM) without affecting bacterial survival Bacteria coagulation among 2–3 bacterial cells occurs under ISs of 500 and 1000 mM without forming large flocculation\n",

      "abstract AbstractUnderstanding porous media flow is inherently a multi-scale challenge, where at the core lies the aggregation of pore-level processes to a continuum, or Darcy-scale, description. This challenge is directly mirrored in image processing, where pore-scale grains and interfaces may be clearly visible in the image, yet continuous Darcy-scale parameters may be what are desirable to quantify. Classical image processing is poorly adapted to this setting, as most techniques do not explicitly utilize the fact that the image contains explicit physical processes. Here, we extend classical image processing concepts to what we define as “physical images” of porous materials and processes within them. This is realized through the development of a new open-source image analysis toolbox specifically adapted to time-series of images of porous materials.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid flow in fractures has the potential to drastically change the economic, environmental, and safety risks associated with a subsurface operation. This work focuses on the analysis of experimental shear fracturing and subsequent shear displacement of a shale specimen that contains multiple pre-existing natural fractures. A triaxial direct shear apparatus with concurrent µCT imaging allowed continuous monitoring of sample permeability and changes in fracture geometry during fracture creation, displacement, and changes in stress. Steady-state, low Reynolds number fluid flow simulations were used to determine the changes of each individual fracture’s hydraulic aperture due to displacement and effective stress. The development of anisotropy in the hydraulic aperture of a generated shear fracture was determined for shear displacements of 0.38, 0.74, and 2.04 mm. At high confining stress (30 MPa), shear displacement significantly reduced the hydraulic aperture of the shear fracture to below flow detectable limits and X-ray imaging resolution (23 × 23 × 23 µm3). The shear generated fracture was found to be more sensitive to changes in effective stress compared to the pre-existing natural fractures. Existing models derived from fluid flow equations accounting for stochastic fracture roughness were able to partially fit the simulated flow properties of the pre-existing fractures, but no model was found to fit the flow properties of the newly formed shear fracture. These results are the first report of simultaneous changes in the geometry and flow properties of surrounding, parallel natural fractures as a shear fracture is generated with varying stress and shear displacement conditions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMedia classification and the construction of pore network models from binary images of porous media hinges on accurately characterizing the pore space. We present a new method for (i) locating critical points, that is, pore body and throat centers, and (ii) partitioning of the pore space using information on the curvature of the distance map (DM) of the binary image. Specifically, we use the local maxima and minima of the determinant map of the Hessian matrix of the DM to locate the center of pore bodies and throats. The locating step provides structural information on the pore system, such as pore body and throat size distributions and the mean coordination number. The partitioning step is based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian, rather than the DM, to characterize the pore space using either watershed or medial-axis transforms. This strategy eliminates the common problem of saddle-induced over-partitioning shared by all traditional marker-based watershed methods and represents an alternative method to determine the skeleton of the pore space without the need for morphological reconstruction.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques are key in the study of porous reservoir rocks. They can provide valuable insight into the pore size distribution of the pore space of a given rock sample due to its dependence on the magnetic fluid/matrix interaction. The pore space is often studied at the μm scale through the use of micro-CT images, which are often composed of hundreds of millions of voxels, posing significant challenges to numerical simulations. In this paper, we present an image-based, fully explicit, and matrix-free finite element implementation for the simulation of NMR relaxation process that is capable of handling such large 3D problems in single GPUs. The chosen explicit time-integration scheme uses a lumped capacitance formulation and stabilization via hyperbolization, and it is capable of handling arbitrary time-step sizes with controllable error levels. The image-based representation of the pore space is used for a memory-efficient, matrix-free formulation of the time integration using massively parallel processes on a single GPU. In addition, we propose the substitution of a global digital roughness correction factor that depends on the porous space’s geometry for a problem-independent local correction factor, based on nodal neighborhoods. We show that the numerical scheme converges with successive refinements as expected and that our local correction coefficient is capable of estimating the correct S/V parameter of several different classical geometries. We tested our formulation against an image-based Random Walk simulation of four digital rock core samples, achieving good agreement between them. We manage to simulate a giga-voxel image-based model on a personal use GPU (less than 10GB of memory use) in 33 min with our FEM implementation.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn a pore network model, microscopic moisture storage and transport processes are modeled at pore level after which this information is extrapolated to obtain macroscopic properties describing the material’s moisture behavior. Such a model is typically validated by comparing measured and simulated macroscopic properties. However, due to the uncertainty associated with the experimental property determination, a possibly incorrect description of the model’s microscopic processes can be overlooked. Assessing the model’s ability to correctly simulate the moisture behavior at pore level is therefore required for its complete validation. To this aim, the moisture stored in the individual pores of unsaturated materials is imaged with the help of X-ray computed tomography images and compared to the moisture distribution simulated with a pore network model. The acquired X-ray computed tomography images clearly show the evolution of the drying process, wherein emptied pores retain water in their irregularly shaped corners. While some corners do not store any moisture, others allow a maximum of 10 % of the pore’s volume to be filled with corner islands. By comparing these images with the pore network model, however, it becomes clear that the amount of water, trapped in these pore corners is heavily overestimated in the model’s current implementation. Since this implementation is commonly used in existing pore network models, this paper proves the need of a detailed investigation of the corner islands in real porous media to formulate a different way of calculating moisture storage in pore corners.\n",

The model is firstly tested on experimental data of droplets’ self-assembly in diverging-converging micro-channels from literature and then used to investigate the trapping/mobilization of the dispersed phase of an emulsion in an idealized series of pores, as influenced by both the Capillary number and the solid walls wettability. Both parameters may vary as the result of an injection of surfactants, a procedure commonly adopted in soil remediation and Enhanced Oil Recovery applications. The analysis shows that the proposed model is able to reproduce correctly the experimental data and gives interesting insights on the trapping/mobilization phenomenon resulting from a modification of the flow conditions caused by the injection of surfactants.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCarbon paper is commonly used to fabricate electrodes for batteries, and its morphology is crucial to the internal mass transport. In this work, geometric models of carbon paper are obtained by experimental and numerical reconstruction methods. The micromorphology of the carbon paper is obtained with a scanning electron microscope and an X-ray computed tomography scanner, and the binary slicing method is used in the experimental reconstruction method. Three different methods are used for numerical reconstruction, namely the layered 2D fibre, 3D fibre stacking and layered 3D fibre stacking methods. The structure and characteristic parameters of the carbon paper, such as pore size distribution, dimensionless specific surface area, effective diffusion coefficient and anisotropic coefficient, are statistically analysed for comparison. The dimensionless effective diffusion coefficients of Li+ in different directions in the electrolyte-filled carbon paper are obtained using lattice Boltzmann method. Results show that the internal structural features directly affect mass transport. The curves of the calculated effective diffusivity versus porosity are well fitted using a power function similar to Bruggeman equation within the porosity range of 0.66–0.86. The anisotropic coefficient is obtained from the effective diffusion coefficient in different directions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractInternal insulation of the building envelope is a prime topic in building physics, due to the risk of moisture problems that this technique entails. As a remedy to these problems, the application of a water-repellent agent, which reduces the amount of absorbed wind-driven rain, has become popular in recent years. When such an agent is applied on a building material, it penetrates the pore network of the material, hereby attaching itself to the pore surfaces and rendering them hydrophobic. It is generally believed that some smaller pores can remain hydrophilic due to the inability of the agent to enter. An in-depth microscopic investigation towards these hydrophilic pores, however, has never been performed. Since direct visualisation of the polymer chains was proven impossible, this paper locates the hydrophilic (parts of) pores in a material, hydrophobised with 3 different water-repellent agents, by imaging the moisture storage at pore level using X-ray computed tomography images at different stages of the desaturation process. While completely hydrophilic pore bodies and throats are not found in the studied material, water storage remains possible in hydrophilic corners of hydrophobised pore bodies and throats. These corner islands are less present than in hydrophilic media and do not form a continuous liquid flow path. Therefore, they provide possible locations for little moisture storage but do not contribute notably to moisture flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDarcy’s law provides a fundamental framework for understanding fluid flow through porous media. However, deviations from its linear superficial velocity-hydraulic gradient (v-i) relationship have been widely reported, at high and low flow rates. While previous studies have attributed the low flow rate deviations to factors such as fluid properties, boundary effects, and experimental artifacts, the role of material heterogeneity has received less attention. This study employs neutron imaging to investigate how rock heterogeneity influences macroscopically observed flow behavior. Volume-controlled percolation tests were conducted on Idaho Gray sandstone cores under near-single-phase conditions using heavy water (D2O) and normal water (H2O) across a wide range of flow rates. Bulk measurements (pore pressure at the sample boundaries and the controlled injection flow rate) revealed a decline in hydraulic conductivity at lower injection rates. Through a novel method for interpreting the breakthrough curves (BTC) derived from the neutron imaging data, we are able to quantify the volume of pores active in the flow during each test. The neutron radiography imaging acquired during the flow tests revealed that flow paths were strongly influenced by the rock’s heterogeneous pore structure, with higher flow rates promoting more uniform front propagation. This suggests greater pore space access at higher injection rates and implies the presence of threshold pressure gradients needed to access different parts of the pore network. The BTC analysis from neutron image shows a decrease in the volume of pores active in the flow (effective porosity) with decreasing injection rates, aligning with the observed reduction in hydraulic conductivity. By linking nonlinearity in vi-curves to variations in effective porosity, this study highlights the critical role of heterogeneity in controlling the fluid flow behavior. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the role of spatial variability in porous media when interpreting macroscopic (bulk) permeability measurements, especially when interpreting apparent deviations from Darcy’s law.\n",

      "abstract AbstractImage-based simulations at pore scale provide direct insight into the impact of the microstructure on flow and transport processes in porous media. Diffusion is an important mechanism of mass transfer in gas or liquid phases, confined in porous media. Similar to fluid flow, the diffusive transport in porous media is a strong function of pore size and structure. Although the effect of porosity, pore connectivity and constrictivity of homogeneous porous media on macroscopic properties is clear, this is not well understood for heterogeneous porous media. This study uses a dual-structural-scale medium to analyze the effect of topological and morphological parameters on effective properties such as permeability and the effective diffusivity. A synthetic porous medium was created by two sizes of small and large glass beads, and 3D pore structure image of the sample was captured by X-ray computed tomography technique. The Stokes and diffusion equations were directly solved on the extracted pore geometry of sample, using a finite element method. The results show a strong nonlinear relationship between constrictivity, as a morphological parameter, with permeability and effective diffusivity. Based on the results obtained from pore-scale imaging and modeling, the connectivity of the pore space is increased by decreasing the Euler number and consequently the permeability and effective diffusivity is increased. Good agreement between image-based computed effective diffusivity with that estimated by van Brakel and Heertjes empirical relation confirms the reliability of this relation for heterogeneous porous medium, which includes constrictivity in addition to porosity and tortuosity, as three important morphological properties.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWider use of timber has the potential to greatly reduce the embodied carbon of construction. Improved chemical treatment could help overcome some of the barriers to wider application of timber, by furthering the durability and/or mechanical properties of this natural material. Improving timber treatment by treating the whole volume of a piece of timber, or tailored sections thereof, requires sound understanding and validated modelling of the natural paths for fluid flow through wood. In this study we carry out a robust analysis of three-dimensional X-ray CT measurements on kiln-dried softwood in the presence of flow and identify small portions of early-wood which are uniquely capable of transporting fluids—herein ‘efficient transport pathways’. We successfully model the effects of these pathways on the liquid uptake by timber by introducing a spatial variability in the amount of aspiration of the bordered pits following kiln drying. The model demonstrates that fluid advances along these efficient transport paths between 10 and 30 times faster than in the remainder of the timber. Identifying these efficient transport pathways offers scope to improve and extend the degree to which timber properties are enhanced at an industrial scale through processes to impregnate timber.\n",

The dye movement was tracked through two cycles of a push-pull flow pattern, alternating between approximately radial outward flow and approximately radial inward flow. Depth-averaged concentration was measured during the experiment and integrated over the angular direction during post-processing to obtain a radial distribution of concentration. The experimental results were replicated using particle tracking, simulating advection and dispersion in the radial direction, including reversible dispersion during extraction. Results show that spreading of the measured concentrations follow a Fickian dispersion model during steps with radial outward flow. During steps with radial inward flow, spreading is reversed and can be modeled as reversible dispersion. The observed reversal in spreading is an indication of incomplete mixing within the pore space.\n",

      "abstract AbstractK2CO3 is seen as a promising heat storage material, available for applications in the domestic sector. For practical purposes, the material is hereby often employed in a packed bed containing millimeter-sized particles. To gain more insight into the hydration behavior of these packed beds, quantitative NMR measurements, capable of following the in-situ hydration behavior, are presented for the first time. It is found that hydration behavior varies significantly, depending on the specific hydration conditions that are chosen. At low airflows hydration is found to proceed via a hydration front, while higher airflows cause the hydration front to widen. Since an increase in flow rate coincided with an increase in the supplied water vapor, hydration is eventually found to proceed in a uniform manner. A comparison between TGA and NMR measurements shows that the overall packed bed hydration kinetics hereby transition to the reaction kinetics of single K2CO3 particles.Graphical Abstract\n",

      "abstract Abstract In this study, the complexity of a steady-state flow through porous media is revealed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Micro-particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) is applied to construct movies of colloidal particles. The calculated velocity vector fields from images are further utilized to obtain laminar flow streamlines. Fluid flow through a single straight channel is used to confirm that quantitative CLSM measurements can be conducted. Next, the coupling between the flow in a channel and the movement within an intersecting dead-end region is studied. Quantitative CLSM measurements confirm the numerically determined coupling parameter from earlier work of the authors. The fluid flow complexity is demonstrated using a porous medium consisting of a regular grid of pores in contact with a flowing fluid channel. The porous media structure was further used as the simulation domain for numerical modeling. Both the simulation, based on solving Stokes equations, and the experimental data show presence of non-trivial streamline trajectories across the pore structures. In view of the results, we argue that the hydrodynamic mixing is a combination of non-trivial streamline routing and Brownian motion by pore-scale diffusion. The results provide insight into challenges in upscaling hydrodynamic dispersion from pore scale to representative elementary volume (REV) scale. Furthermore, the successful quantitative validation of CLSM-based data from a microfluidic model fed by an electrical syringe pump provided a valuable benchmark for qualitative validation of computer simulation results.

      "abstract AbstractNumerical simulation studies of water–rock interaction mechanisms and pore-scale multiphase flow properties often require high computational efficiency and realistic geometries to enable a fast and accurate description of hydrodynamic behavior. In this paper, we have chosen to use deep learning models to achieve these requirements, firstly by using encoder structures to refine the image segmentation of void-solid structures on complex geometries of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of porous media through few-shot learning (FSL), not only obtaining an accuracy of 0.97, but also reducing the amount of annotation work. We then focus on pore-scale three-dimensional (3D) structural reconstruction using the unpaired image-to-image translation method, optimizing the cycle-consistent adversarial network (cycle-GAN) model via sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) to transfer marine sedimentary sandstone features to the initial image, and the geometric stochastic reconstruction problems are transformed into optimization problems. Subsequently, the computational efficiency was improved by a factor of 21 by implementing the lattice Boltzmann simulation method (LBM) accelerated by GPU through compute-unified device architecture (CUDA). The flow field distribution and absolute permeability of the extracted 2D samples and the reconstructed 3D porous media structure were simulated. The results showed that our method could rapidly and accurately reconstruct the 3D structures of a given feature, ensuring statistical equivalence between the 3D reconstructed structures and 2D samples. We solve the problem of extrapolation-based 3D reconstruction of porous media and significantly reduce the time spent on structure extraction and numerical calculations.\n",

A pressure infiltration equipment was made to infiltrate the preforms. The preforms were infiltrated at constant temperature (800 °C) and pressure (400 kPa) with different pressure-applied times (3, 5, 8, 11 and 15 s). Since the discrepancy between the infiltration heights measured in the experiment and calculated with the general infiltration equation was found, a modified infiltration equation was proposed considering the pore characteristic parameters from 3D μ-CT.

      "abstract AbstractCharge transfer at the solid–liquid interface plays a key role in micro and nanoscale flow. Although numerous experimental and simulation studies have characterized this phenomenon in simple single micro-nano tubes or disconnected bundles of micro-nano tubes, this interfacial behavior in natural porous media remains poorly understood. To fill the research gap, we designed a specialized flooding apparatus integrated with the direct current (DC) electric field. Five samples from the same outcrop block quarried from the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin were selected to perform the experiments to characterize the influence of charge transfer at the solid–liquid interface on liquid transport in porous media. The experimental methods involve the constant velocity flow experiments, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests, and inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICPES) tests. The results show that the interfacial transfer can affect not only the flow resistance of ionic liquids in porous media, but also the fluids distribution in pore space. When the forward electric field is imposed, the charges migrate in the same direction as the pressure-driven flow, which could reduce the flow resistance. A lower voltage would allow water to fill more pores. However, the reverse electric field increases the flow resistance and has little effect on the distribution of pore water. For the simultaneous flow (applies an electric field when the flow begins), the electrolysis of water is obvious after a long duration of the high voltage, resulting in numerous bubbles that reduces the large-size pore water, and promoting the corrosion of calcium-bearing minerals. The gained knowledge in this work is of great significance for the understanding of the effect of electrokinetic transfer at the solid–liquid interface on fluids flow in tight porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe compare two conceptually different stochastic microstructure models, i.e., a graph-based model and a pluri-Gaussian model, that have been introduced to model the transport properties of three-phase microstructures occurring, e.g., in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. Besides comparing both models, we present new results regarding the relationship between model parameters and certain microstructure characteristics. In particular, an analytical expression is obtained for the expected length of triple phase boundary per unit volume in the pluri-Gaussian model. As a case study, we consider 3D image data which show a representative cutout of a solid oxide fuel cell anode obtained by FIB-SEM tomography. The two models are fitted to image data and compared in terms of morphological characteristics (like mean geodesic tortuosity and constrictivity) as well as in terms of effective transport properties. The Stokes flow in the pore phase and effective conductivities in the solid phases are computed numerically for realizations of the two models as well as for the 3D image data using Fourier methods. The local and effective physical responses of the model realizations are compared to those obtained from 3D image data. Finally, we assess the accuracy of the two methods to predict permeability as well as electronic and ionic conductivities of the anode.\n",

      "abstract AbstractBased on microfocus X-ray computed tomography analyses, the relationship between the characteristics of pore structure and fluid flow behavior was investigated through the single-phase flow experiment. The macroscopic bulk fluid seepage behavior was fundamentally explained by the microscale flow mechanism considering all the porous microstructure analysis of artificial cores. The results indicate that the pore size and connectivity have significant effects on the initial permeability of the rock cores. The permeabilities obtained from different methods have a linear law relationship with porosities in tested artificial cores. The results also suggest that the permeability of core decreases exponentially with the increase in effective stress. The inner different pore structures have an important influence on the stress-dependent fluid flow in synthetic porous rocks. The polynomial equation yields well fittings of the artificial core which has the poor pore sorting characteristic. The permeabilities of the artificial core are more significantly affected by changes in the low effective stress range. The larger the pore channel of the artificial core is, the greater influence on permeability the pressure will have. The stress sensitivity of artificial core increases as the grain diameter decreases. The heterogeneous coefficient and the stress sensitivity of permeability are positively correlated.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe evolution of pore structure caused by particle retention is a function of heterogeneity and nonlinear coupling of particle transport and fluid flow. Pore-scale modelling enables us to elucidate the role of various mechanisms controlling particle transport and deposition. This study incorporated the Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to investigate the spatial and temporal deposition of particles using a benchmark data set for an artificial column made of glass beads for validation. The velocity field and trajectory of particles were determined by solving the Navier–Stokes and momentum balance equations. When the mean diameter of particles is smaller than the image voxel size, several particles are required to occupy a pore voxel. Particles with low velocity that cannot escape from the adhesion forces of surfaces are considered as deposited. The solid volume fraction of pore voxels adjacent to solid voxels changes dynamically through particle deposition. The role of surface deposition and clogging mechanisms during various experimental simulation scenarios was analysed using an image-based technique. Mean injection velocity, particle size, surface adhesion forces, and surface roughness are considered as sensitivity parameters. The results show that the clogging mechanism was responsible for the structure permeability impairment rather than the surface deposition, when particle size and surface adhesion forces increased. However, the clogging mechanism did not affect permeability when surface roughness increased. Particle retention shows a maximum value around a critical velocity where the spatial particle retention switched from filter cake development to homogenous retention.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNatural fractures in subsurface reservoirs are frequently partially cemented with mineral precipitates, and it is unclear if fracture permeability models developed for rough barren fractures are applicable for fractures where roughness originates from cement linings. Here, we use a digital rock physics workflow to quantify the error in fracture permeability predicted by these models for five digitally synthesized rough fractures and four fractures imaged using three-dimensional X-ray computed microtomography. Samples include a rough, artificially-induced barren fracture in sandstone, a cement-lined natural fracture in limestone sampled from outcrop, and two cement-bridged natural fractures in tight-gas sandstones sampled from reservoir core. The images are then processed, segmented, characterized to determine statistical moments of the aperture distribution, and used in lattice Boltzmann model flow simulations. We address complications in measuring aperture distributions from images when the fracture pore space morphology deviates from the typical theoretical description of rough fractures and evaluate three different methods of measuring local aperture. The alternative cubic law using the nominal mean aperture is found to overestimate fracture permeability by upwards of one to two orders of magnitude, while the fracture permeability models using statistical moments of the aperture distribution are far more accurate for both rough barren and partially cemented fractures. We also define an empirical description of the upper and lower bounds of fracture permeability estimates as a function of relative roughness that is applicable to both rough barren and partially cemented fractures.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe effect of wettability on waterflooding oil recovery and the associated pore-scale displacement mechanisms are systematically investigated during flow processes in limestone core samples with a broad spectrum of wettability. Using a miniature core-flooding setup integrated with micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging apparatus, we, for the first time, characterize in situ equilibrium wettability states and demonstrate capillary interactions of the flowing phases in strongly water-wet (SWW), intermediate-wet (IW), weakly oil-wet (WOW), and strongly oil-wet (SOW) systems. The microscale observations were then employed to explain the recovery results obtained from replicate, macroscale experiments. The waterflooding parameters, such as experimental temperature, brine composition, defending and invading phase properties, and the initial water saturation, were maintained nearly identical in all of the waterflooding tests, thereby ensuring that the wettability state was the only factor that controlled the variations in waterflood oil recoveries. We provide pore-scale evidences of various pore-scale displacement mechanisms and the consequent fluid configurations in systems with different wettability states. These findings are then linked to the recovery trends of macroscale experiments. The production from IW, WOW, and SOW cases portrayed a prolonged oil recovery owing to the gradual invasion of brine into small and intermediate-sized oil-wet pores. The IW case showed the highest oil recovery among all cases. Moreover, when the injection flow rate was increased, the oil recovery was gradually increased for the IW, WOW, and SOW systems, whereas no significant additional production was observed in the case of SWW.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPore network models (PNMs) offer a computationally efficient way to analyse transport in porous media. Their effectiveness depends on how well they represent the topology and geometry of real pore systems, for example as imaged by X-ray CT. The performance of two popular algorithms, maximum ball and watershed, is evaluated for three porous systems: an idealised medium with known pore throat properties and two rocks with different morphogenesis—carbonate and sandstone. It is demonstrated that while the extracted PNM simulates simple flow (permeability) with acceptable accuracy, their topological and geometric properties are significantly different. This suggests that such PNM may not serve more complex studies, such as reactive/convective transport of contaminants or bacteria, and further research is necessary to improve the interpretation of real pore spaces with networks. Linear topology–geometry relations are derived and presented to stimulate development of more realistic PNM.\n",

      "abstract AbstractVacuum chambers used in high-energy particle accelerator experiments are conventionally made of bulk beryllium, which shows significant drawbacks due to cost and toxicity. An alternative solution could be to develop chambers made of polymer-based composites. Since these materials exhibit high outgassing not compatible with an ultra-high vacuum environment, a suitable gas-tight coating is required. Cold spray deposition of aluminum can be a solution, provided that the coating behaves as a perfect vacuum barrier. Porosity, especially percolating porous networks, is key to coating gas tightness issues. This work addresses the relationship between porosity and gas-tightness in cold spray coatings. To do so, coatings with different porosity were achieved playing with powder morphology, composition, and process parameters. Their gas tightness was evaluated by helium leak tests. Classical microscopy, being essentially a 2D analysis, is strongly limited when dealing with 3D properties as porosity percolation. For this reason, 3D X-ray microtomography images of coatings were obtained and treated by image analysis methods: pores were compared in terms of size and shape. Overall porosity properties, including percolation and a homogeneity criterion, were also investigated. Percolating porosity was highlighted for several samples which showed poor gas-tightness properties. The permeability of percolating pore structures was then numerically computed by a fast Fourier transform-based method, to quantify the mass flow through the coating. Results of those computations were finally compared to experimental coating leak rate measurements, in an effort to elucidate the link between gas tightness and morphology of the pore space.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this study, we conduct a comprehensive history matching study for the FluidFlower benchmark model. This benchmark was prepared and organized by the University of Bergen, the University of Stuttgart, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for promoting understanding of the complex physics of geological carbon storage (GCS) through in-house experiments and numerical simulations. This paper synthesizes the experiences of history matching the benchmark data encountered by the Delft-DARTS and CSIRO participants. History matching is first performed based on a low-dimensional-zonated structured model using a simple Poisson-like solver. The permeability of six facies and two faults is inferred in this stage to match the digitized concentration data. The history matching is then further enhanced to richer spatial and physical models to capture the spatial variation of permeability and buoyancy effects, using an unstructured grid. Efficient adjoint methods are used to evaluate the gradient used in the optimization of data misfits or equivalent Bayesian log-likelihoods. With efficient optimization methods available for both maximum a posteriori model inference and Randomized Maximum Likelihood methods for model uncertainty, we perform history matching using both binary and continuous concentration observations. The results show that the tracer plumes in the enriched model match the experimental plumes more accurately compared with the results from the parsimonious-zonated model. The history matching results based on the concentration observations provide more similar plume shapes compared with the case based on the binary observations. The permeability difference between the model before and after history matching reveals that the tracer plume zone and the high permeable zone are the regions of high sensitivity in terms of data misfit between the model response and observations. Surprisingly, CO\\(_2\\) concentration plume forecasts based on these history-matched models were not especially sensitive to the improvements observed in the enhanced model.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe use a Darcy-scale simulator to extract residual oil saturation, forced imbibition capillary pressure, and relative permeability by history matching to measured pressure drop and cumulative oil production during multi-speed centrifuge experiments and constant-rate waterfloods in Indiana limestone cores under four different wettability states established by adding different naphthenic acids to the oil phase. Residual oil saturation decreases monotonically as advancing bulk contact angle increases from \\(\\theta _\\text {a} = 110^\\circ \\) to \\(150^\\circ \\), in sharp contrast to the non-monotonic dependence displayed by the core-averaged oil saturation which are often mis-interpreted to be representative of true residual saturation. The magnitude of the capillary pressure required to establish a particular water saturation increases with \\(\\theta _\\text {a}\\). Saturation-normalized water relative permeability exceeds one at \\(\\theta _\\text {a}\\ge 125^\\circ \\), with equivalent slip lengths of up to O(200) nm. The simulations indicate that capillary end effects may be significant during displacement experiments under typical laboratory conditions, even in mixed-wet media of relatively low permeability, and highlight the importance of using numerical simulation to interpret displacement experiments under capillary-dominated conditions.\n",

      "data_availability_section NotesIn this paper, all contact angles are defined through the aqueous phase.One could characterize a mixed-wet oil/brine/rock system using two contact angles instead of one: one angle representing the oil-contacted grain surface and one angle representing a surface that remains in contact with bulk water (cf. Fig. 1). The challenge in this approach lies in the contact angle measurement on the latter: it is not practical to measure the contact angle on a pristine surface using the test oil of interest, since exposure to its constituents will alter the wettability of the surface during the measurement. One way to circumvent this challenge is to measure the contact angle using a gas (e.g. air) or a synthetic oil free of surface-active components (e.g. n-decane) as the non-aqueous phase (e.g. Liu and Buckley 1997; Wu et al. 2008). However, this approach has the disadvantage that the measured contact angle is not directly related to in situ values in the oil/brine/rock system of interest.Equation (7b) is based on \\(\\left\\langle S_\\text {w} \\right\\rangle (0)\\) established from \\(S_\\text {oi} = 0.90\\) (core AK, Table S1). Equations (7a) and (7c) are lines of best-fit to \\(\\left\\langle S_\\text {w} \\right\\rangle (0)\\) measured by Tanino and Blunt (2013). Further details can be found in the Supplementary Materials S4.One exception is \\(L_\\text {w}\\) and \\(T_\\text {w}\\) for waterflood N, which were constrained to a narrower range of \\(L_\\text {w,TB/I} \\le L_\\text {w} \\le 6 \\, L_\\text {w,TB/I}\\) and \\(T_\\text {w,TB/I} \\le T_\\text {w} \\le 1.3 \\, T_\\text {w,TB/I}\\), where \\(L_\\text {w,TB/I}, \\, T_\\text {w,TB/I}\\) are the optimized values of \\(L_\\text {w}, \\, T_\\text {w}\\) for waterflood TB/I (Table 3).History matching using Eq. (9) instead of Eq. (19) yields unphysically large \\(k_\\text {rw}(S_\\text {or})\\) for waterflood N and \\(S_\\text {w}(0)\\) for all waterfloods, suggesting that Eq. (9) does not accurately capture the \\(S_\\text {w}\\) dependence of \\(p_\\text {c}\\).For waterfloods AD, AH (\\(\\theta _\\text {a}=135^\\circ \\)), optimized values of \\(J_\\text {C}^+\\) at \\(\\theta _\\text {a}=125^\\circ \\) and \\(150^\\circ \\) were considered. The larger of the two were used to define the upper limit and the smaller of the two were used to define the lower limit of \\({{J}}^*\\) (Eq. 22).We did not simply take \\(k_\\text {ro}(S_\\text {wi}) = k_\\text {ro}(S_\\text {oi})\\) as a fixed parameter because the curvature of the derived \\(k_\\text {ro}(S_\\text {w})\\) is such that \\(k_\\text {ro}(S_\\text {w})\\) displays a relatively strong dependence on \\(S_\\text {w}\\) near irreducible water saturation (Fig. 4).Details of the calculation can be found in Supplementary Material Text S6.AcknowledgementsMC was supported by the University of Aberdeen College of Physical Sciences studentship.

      "abstract AbstractThe effect of heterogeneity induced by highly permeable fracture networks on viscous miscible fingering in porous media is examined using high-resolution numerical simulations. We consider the planar injection of a less viscous fluid into a two-dimensional fractured porous medium that is saturated with a more viscous fluid. This problem contains two sets of fundamentally different preferential flow regimes; the first is caused by the viscous fingering, and the second is due to the permeability contrasts between the fractures and the rock matrix. We study the transition from the regime where the flow is dominated by the viscous instabilities, to the regime where the heterogeneity induced by the fractures define the flow paths. Our findings reveal that even minor permeability differences between the rock matrix and fractures significantly influence the behavior of viscous fingering. The interplay between the viscosity contrast and permeability contrast leads to the preferential channeling of the less viscous fluid through the fractures. Consequently, this channeling process stabilizes the displacement front within the rock matrix, ultimately suppressing the occurrence of viscous fingering, particularly for higher permeability contrasts. We explore three fracture geometries: two structured and one random configuration and identify a complex interaction between these geometries and the development of unstable flow. While we find that the most important factor determining the effect of the fracture network is the ratio of fluid volume flowing through the fractures and the rock matrix, the exact point for the cross-over regime is dependent on the geometry of the fracture network.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAn efficient compositional framework is developed for simulation of CO\\(_{2}\\) storage in saline aquifers during a full-cycle injection, migration and post-migration processes. Essential trapping mechanisms, including structural, dissolution, and residual trapping, which operate at different time scales, are accurately captured in the presented unified framework. In particular, a parameterization method is proposed to efficiently describe the relevant physical processes. The proposed framework is validated by comparing the dynamics of gravity-induced convective transport with that reported in the literature. Results show good agreement for both the characteristics of descending fingers and the associated dissolution rate. The developed simulator is then applied to study the FluidFlower benchmark model. An experimental setup with heterogeneous geological layers is discretized into a two-dimensional computational domain where numerical simulation is performed. Impacts of hysteresis and the diffusion of CO\\(_{2}\\) in liquid phase on the migration and trapping of CO\\(_{2}\\) plume are investigated. Inclusion of the hysteresis effect does not affect plume migration in this benchmark model, whereas diffusion plays an important role in promoting convective mixing. This work casts a promising approach to predict the migration of the CO\\(_{2}\\) plume, and to assess the amount of trapping from different mechanisms for long-term CO\\(_{2}\\) storage.\n",

Evolution of the interface between saturated and partially saturated layers of a soil is of concern in this paper. In particular, the description of a drainage/imbibition front is developed gathering the two classical saturated and partially saturated poromechanical problems, with pressures of both fluids and solid displacement as unknowns. The presented model enables saturated and partially saturated layers to coexist without considering gaseous air dissolving into liquid water. Nucleation or collapse of the drainage/imbibition front moving from or reaching an air connected boundary is characterised considering the Signorini contact conditions on the liquid phase. The model abilities are confirmed numerically, via finite element simulations, showing among other that this new description of interface motion does not imply hysteresis phenomena. Parametric investigation developed with respect to drainage kinetics and thickness of the layer which regularises the interface between the saturated and the partially saturated domain are also provided.\n",

      "abstract AbstractModeling flow in vegetative fuel beds is a key component in any detailed physics-based tool for simulating wildland fire dynamics. Current approaches for drag modeling, particularly those employed in multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, tend to take a relatively simple form and have been applied to a wide range of fuel structures. The suitability of these approaches has not been rigorously tested for conditions which may be encountered in a wildland fire context. Here, we focus on beds of Pinus rigida needle litter and undertake a two-part study to quantify the drag and evaluate the capabilities of a multiphase large eddy simulation CFD model, the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator. In the first part, bed drag was measured in a wind tunnel under a range of conditions. The results were fit to a Forchheimer model, and the bed permeability was quantified. A traditional approach employed in the multiphase formulation was compared to the parameterized Forchheimer equation and was found to over-predict the drag by a factor of 1.2–2.5. In the second part, the development of a velocity profile above and within a discrete fuel layer was measured. Using the Forchheimer equation obtained in the first part of the study, the CFD model was able to replicate a qualitatively consistent velocity profile development. Within the fuel bed, the model appeared to under-predict the velocity magnitudes, which may be the result of unresolved pore-scale flow dynamics.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe study the mechanisms of advective trapping in composite porous media that consist of circular inclusions of distributed hydraulic conductivity embedded in a high conductivity matrix. Advective trapping occurs when solute enters low velocity regions in the media. Transport is analyzed in terms of breakthrough curves measured at the outlet of the system. The curve’s peak behavior depends on the volume fraction occupied by the inclusions, while the tail behavior depends on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity values. In order to quantify the observed behaviors, we derive two equivalent upscaled transport models. First, we derive a Lagrangian trapping model using the continuous-time random walk framework that is parameterized in terms of volume fraction and the distribution of conductivities in the inclusions. Second, we establish a non-local partial differential equation for the mobile solute concentration by volume averaging of the microscale transport equation. We show the equivalence between the two models as well as (first-order) multirate mass transfer models. The upscaled approach parameterized by medium and flow properties captures all features of the observed solute breakthrough curves and sheds new light on the modeling of advective trapping in heterogeneous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractUnderstanding hyporheic processes is key to support stream health and functioning. The present study addresses the impact of weak buoyancy effects on hyporheic exchange. In this context, we focus on the density-driven processes on pore scale, which had not been investigated so far to our knowledge. For that purpose, the transport of an active scalar across the interface between a turbulent free-flow region and a random sphere pack with macroscopically flat surface was investigated by pore-resolved single-domain direct numerical simulation. At a permeability Reynolds number of \\(Re_K = 1.63\\) and a friction Reynolds number of \\(Re_\\tau = 173\\), seven simulation cases were evaluated with Rayleigh–Darcy numbers varying within the range of \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} \\in [-20, 400]\\), where \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} < 0\\) represents stabilising and \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} > 0\\) destabilising buoyancy effects. While turbulent scalar transport dominates the well-mixed free-flow region, dispersive transport contributes considerably to the scalar flux within the sphere pack, even in the absence of buoyancy effects. The latter observation implies that the velocity and scalar field must be spatially heterogeneous. Under these conditions, even weak destabilising buoyancy effects can enhance spatial variations, strengthen preferred scalar advection paths, and increase the hyporheic flux. A stabilising stratification of the scalar field has the opposite effect and reduces the vertical exchange within the porous medium. We conclude that even though weak buoyancy effects do not introduce genuine density-driven instabilities, they have a clear quantitative impact on hyporheic exchange with far-reaching ecological implications.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Solute transport and mixing at channel-flow–porous media interfaces are strongly influenced by velocity and turbulence structures near porous media, and such coupled channel-flow–porous media systems are commonly observed in nature. However, the effects of pore-scale flows on solute transport in the coupled systems are currently unclear. In this study, we combine particle image velocimetry experiments and large eddy simulations to resolve the pore-scale flow characteristics over and within a porous bed. Then, we perform solute transport simulations by coupling the pore-scale flow fields with a particle-tracking model and show that the pore-scale flows inherent to porous media structure control solute transport. Pore-scale flow properties such as preferential downward–upward flows and vortices occurring near the channel-flow–porous media interface are shown to exert dominant control over interfacial mass exchange and solute transport. To clarify the effects of pore-scale flows on reach-scale transport, we conduct macroscale transport modeling with a spatially averaged stream-wise velocity profile. Because the profile-based model does not incorporate important pore-scale flow features, it significantly overestimates mass transfer into the porous bed, thereby exacerbating late-time tailings in breakthrough curves. Finally, a spatial Markov model, a type of upscaled stochastic transport model, is shown to effectively capture the pore-scale interfacial transport mechanisms via a velocity transition matrix. Our findings confirm that solute transport through channel-flow–porous media interfaces is controlled not only by interfacial turbulent-mixing profiles but also by detailed pore-scale flow structures. Article Highlights We demonstrate the effects of pore-scale flows on solute transport in coupled turbulent channel-flow–porous media systems Pore structure near the interface exerts dominant control over interfacial mass exchange and solute transport Spatial Markov model effectively upscales the effects of pore-scale flows on solute transport.\n",

      "abstract AbstractColloid particle size plays an important role in contaminant adsorption and clogging in the hyporheic zone, but it remains unclear how the particle size changes during the transport of colloids. This study investigated the variation of the particle size of colloids in the overlying water and the effects of settlement and hyporheic exchange via laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with two main factors settlement and hyporheic exchange being considered. The results show that the particle size distribution varies when colloids transport in hyporheic zone, and both settlement and hyporheic exchange are involved in the exchange of colloids between stream and streambed. Large-sized particles are mainly controlled by settlement and advection and thus their concentration in the overlying water decreases more quickly; but small-sized particles are mainly controlled by hyporheic exchange and thus their concentration decreases more slowly, and some particles can be resuspended. The increase of retention coefficient and settling velocity will accelerate the transfer of colloids into the streambed. This study may provide important insights into the variation of the particle size of colloids in the overlying water and the effects of settlement and hyporheic exchange.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEfficient decision-making in foam-assisted applications, such as soil remediation and enhanced oil recovery, frequently relies on intricate models that are developed based on a selection of component models that describe the underlying physics of the phenomenon at hand. Modeling foam flow is challenging due to the complex interactions between foam properties, porous media characteristics, and flow dynamics, which results in significant uncertainties in model predictions. Previous studies on uncertainty in foam flow models have only analyzed foam properties and relative permeability separately, leading to limited reliability of the findings. This study aims to bridge the gap of integrating foam implicit-texture parametrization and relative permeability into an uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework to evaluate multi-phase foam flow simulations in porous media more comprehensively than previously available. A foam representation based on the CMG-STARS and a Corey relative permeability model are employed. Bayesian techniques and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) are employed for inverse and forward UQ. These techniques enable the quantification of uncertainties and the identification of influential parameters within the model. An initial guess algorithm to represent prior beliefs objectively is introduced for the inverse uncertainty quantification step. An in-house foam displacement simulator, aided by a surrogate model, is employed in forward uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. The research findings contribute to understanding and designing reliable foam flow simulations. Sensitivity analyses indicate that incremental strategies to fit parameters can produce inaccurate predictions. Additionally, the article discusses how inaccurately estimated parameters can lead to underestimation or overestimation of foam performance in simulations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractProduced water re-injection (PWRI) is the water management strategy with least environmental impact during petroleum recovery. A major challenge, however, is clogging of pores in the injection reservoir by particles suspended in the produced water. Basic understanding of transport and retention of particles in porous media is required to better handle this injectivity decline. Here, a microfluidic technique was used to study the transport and retention of monodisperse silica particles in a porous network. The amount of particle retained in the network, the distribution of the particles in the network and the aggregation state of the particles depended on particle–particle and particle–pore wall interactions. These interactions were modulated by varying the salinity of the suspension introduced into the network and by adsorbing surface-active additives (a non-ionic surfactant, a cationic flocculant and an anionic flocculant) onto the particles. The latter was done to mimic how adsorption of production chemicals onto solid particles in produced water influence their transport in reservoirs. In accordance with the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, high-energy barriers prevented both aggregation of particles and retention of particles in the pore network at low salinities. A threshold salinity was reached, where the energy barriers were reduced so that individual particles were retained in the pore network. Further increase in the salinity resulted in aggregation of particles prior to the network and most of the aggregates were accumulated close the entrance of the network. Adsorption of a non-ionic surfactant provided sufficient steric hindrance to prevent aggregation of particles at high salinities, and the retention of particles became more evenly distributed in the network. The adsorption of the anionic flocculant resulted in steric hindrances that reduced the retention of particles in the network, while the opposite was seen when the cationic flocculant was adsorbed onto the particles. The extent of re-mobilization of retained particles indicated the strength of the particle–pore wall interactions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractInertial permeability is a critical parameter that quantifies the pressure loss caused by inertia in fluid flow through rough-walled fractures, described by the Forchheimer equation. This study investigates the size effect on the inertial permeability of rough-walled fractures and establishes a characterization model for fractures of varying sizes. Numerical simulations are conducted on five large-scale fracture models (1 m × 1 m) by resolving the Navier–Stokes equations. Smaller models are extracted from these large-scale fracture models for detailed size-dependent analysis. The results show that the peak asperity height (ξ), asperity height variation coefficient (η), and the fitting coefficient of the aperture cumulative distribution curve (C) significantly affect inertial permeability. Specifically, as ξ increases, the fluid flow experiences greater resistance, resulting in a reduction of inertial permeability. Similarly, a larger η corresponds to more variable asperity heights, further decreasing permeability. In contrast, a higher C value, indicating a more uniform aperture distribution, increases inertial permeability by facilitating smoother fluid flow. Quantitatively, the relationship between inertial permeability and fracture size follows a power law, with the sensitivity to roughness parameters diminishing as fracture size increases. This characterization model provides a method for scaling from laboratory-scale to field-scale fractures, offering practical implications for hydraulic engineering and subsurface fluid flow management.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany shallow ex-situ and in-situ remediation treatments come from the contamination of underground soils and groundwater sources by organic hydrocarbon components called non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). These contaminants, if leaking, can impose long-term threats causing environmental and health concerns. One of the versatile in-situ remediation techniques is using surfactant/foam processes that can overcome subsurface heterogeneity and improve NAPL removal. Motivated by an earlier study of successful implementation of surfactant/foam in-situ remediation processes, this simulation study investigates the next phase of the research, that is, (i) understanding two different roles of foams during the treatment: foams for “mobility control” vs. foams for “blocking” and (ii) evaluating the potential of blocking foams by placing foams downstream (i.e., foam injected into the downstream extraction wells, but surfactant is still injected into the upstream injection wells). When twenty-four different scenarios are taken into consideration for the 23-days pilot test with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells, the results from the simulations reveal that using foams for blocking purpose is as efficient as, or more efficient than, foams for mobility-control purpose, exhibiting the oil recovery up to near 94.9%. Additional simulation efforts also show that foams as a blocking agent have a unique advantage over mobility-control foams because of less pressure buildup required and, therefore, less chance of displacing the contaminants out of the treatment area. This feasibility study of examining foams as a blocking agent focuses on vertical wells currently, which can be regarded as a stepping stone into the broader range of similar applications with horizontal wells located in hilly terrain.\n",

      "abstract AbstractReactive transport modeling in unique chamosite, illite, and kaolinite monomineralic clay reservoirs was performed to predict spatial and mineralogical control on H2(aq) distribution and flow dynamics at simulated underground hydrogen storage pressure and temperature conditions in high permeability depleted oil reservoirs and lower permeability sandstones. Results are normalized against simulations performed in pure quartz for comparative purposes and to serve as a benchmark for H2 storage in sandstone or quartz-arenite reservoirs. Isobaric and isothermal condition results indicate that Péclet numbers increase with volume rate of injected fluid. Advection-mediated transport is ubiquitous for injection rates between 0.01 and 1.0 L per second, although diffusion-mediated transport is prevalent in the center of the RMT block at 0.001 L per second injection. Source/sink term and Péclet number analysis indicate that the effect of mineralogy on H2(aq) transport is small. Flow velocities in kaolinite are typically the fastest, but chamosite Péclet numbers are greatest. This suggests that kaolinite favors diffusion, chamosite favors advection, and illite is intermediate. A more accurate reflection of underground hydrogen storage conditions incorporating temperature and pressure gradients, permeability anisotropy, and mineralogical heterogeneity shows a decrease in Péclet numbers proportional to distance from injection well. Thus, along the reservoir-caprock boundary and in the absence of cushion gas, H2(aq) loss through diffusion is probable. Although quantitative flow regime analysis cannot be determined at many grid point locations due to uniform H2(aq) concentration, these locations are very likely diffusion dominant.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEvaporation of droplets formed at the interface of a coupled free-flow–porous medium system enormously affects the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between the two domains. In this work, we develop a model to describe multiple droplets’ evaporation at the interface, in which new sets of coupling conditions including the evaporating droplets are developed to describe the interactions between the free flow and the porous medium. Employing pore-network modeling to describe the porous medium, we take the exchanges occurring on the droplet–pore and droplet–free-flow interfaces into account. In this model, we describe the droplet evaporation as a diffusion-driven process, where vapor from the droplet surface diffuses into the surrounding free flow due to the concentration gradient. To validate the model, we compare the simulation results for the evaporation of a single droplet in a channel with experimental data, demonstrating that our model accurately describes the evaporation process. Then, we examine the impact of free-flow and porous medium properties on droplet evaporation. The results show that, among other factors, velocity and relative humidity in the free-flow domain, as well as pore temperature in the porous medium, play key roles in the droplet evaporation process.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we design a Co-flow microchannel capillary device to numerically simulate the generation of double-emulsion droplets by a level set method. The three velocity vortices generated during the generation of double-emulsion droplets and the pressure variation on the z-axis were systematically investigated. The effects of the dimensionless numbers Cain, Caout, and Wein on the volumes of the inner droplets and outer droplets are discussed. The results show that three velocity vortices can be generated during the generation of double-emulsion droplets due to the inhomogeneous force on the droplets. The internal pressure of the inner droplet is much larger than the internal pressure of the outer droplet, and the larger the volume of the droplet the smaller the internal pressure of the droplet. With the increase in the Cain, the volume of the outer droplet increases and the volume of the inner droplet increases and then decreases. As the Caout increases, the volume of the outer and inner droplets decreases significantly. With the increase in the Wein, the volume of the inner droplet increases significantly, and the volume of the outer droplet increases and then decreases. In view of the above phenomenon that the volume of droplet increases and then decreases, we can conclude that the two factors, velocity and pressure, affect the volume of droplet at the same time.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid injection can induce mechanical deformation in granular porous media due to the elevation of internal pore fluid pressure. This gains more significance when more than two immiscible fluids are involved, attributable to capillary and viscous drag forces. Such a coupled hydromechanical behavior associated with immiscible fluid flows plays an important role in injection, storage, and recovery of fluids in deformable porous media. This study presents a dimensionless map with newly proposed dimensionless parameters to predict deformation occurrence due to an immiscible fluid flow in deformable porous media. A series of hydromechanically coupled pore network simulations are first performed while varying the capillary number, mobility ratio, medium stiffness, and effective confining stress over orders of magnitudes. The compilation of simulation results with previously published Hele–Shaw experiment results is analyzed with the dimensionless parameters, such as the capillary number, mobility ratio, particle-level force ratios, and particle-level pressure ratios. Particularly, the particle-level pressure ratios include the capillary pressure ratio, defined as the ratio of capillary pressure to fracture pressure, and the viscous drag pressure, defined as the ratio of viscous drag pressure to fracture pressure. The dimensionless map based on the particle-level pressure ratios, where the capillary pressure ratio and viscous drag pressure ratio are defined as the ratios of capillary pressure and viscous drag pressure to fracture pressure, effectively delineates four deformation regimes—no deformation, capillary-induced deformation, drag-driven deformation, and mixed-mode deformation. The results demonstrate that capillary-induced deformation occurs when the capillary pressure ratio is greater than 10−1, while drag-driven deformation is observed when the viscous drag pressure ratio exceeds 10−2. The presented dimensionless map and dimensionless parameters are expected to be applicable for geological subsurface processes, including geological storage of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and enhanced oil recovery.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPhysically consistent coupling conditions at the fluid–porous interface with correctly determined effective parameters are necessary for accurate modeling and simulation of various applications. To describe single-fluid-phase flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems, the Stokes/Darcy equations are typically used together with the conservation of mass across the interface, the balance of normal forces and the Beavers–Joseph condition on the tangential velocity. The latter condition is suitable for flows parallel to the interface but not applicable for arbitrary flow directions. Moreover, the value of the Beavers–Joseph slip coefficient is uncertain. In the literature, it is routinely set equal to one that is not correct for many applications, even if the flow is parallel to the porous layer. In this paper, we reformulate the generalized interface condition on the tangential velocity component, recently developed for arbitrary flows in Stokes/Darcy systems, such that it has the same analytical form as the Beavers–Joseph condition. We compute the effective coefficients appearing in this modified condition using theory of homogenization with boundary layers. We demonstrate that the modified Beavers–Joseph condition is applicable for arbitrary flow directions to the fluid–porous interface. In addition, we propose an efficient two-level numerical algorithm based on simulated annealing to compute the optimal Beavers–Joseph parameter.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe permeability of natural porous media, such as soils and rocks, usually possesses uncertainties due to the randomness and spatial variation of microscopic pore structures. It is of great importance to develop an effective methodology to obtain statistical properties of permeability for porous media. In this work, an efficient approach is developed by combining the sphere packing algorithm, lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), and probabilistic collocation method (PCM). The porous media are generated by sphere packings of a specified size distribution, and the isotropy and representative elementary volume are verified by statistical analyses. Fluid flow in the complex pore structures is numerically resolved by LBM, with the permeability calculated by Darcy’s law. The uncertainty of permeability can be quantified by PCM with only several porosity samplings required at predetermined collocation points. In addition, the porosity–permeability relationships can be acquired efficiently. Numerical results indicate that, with the proposed approach, the computational efforts are reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the Monte Carlo simulations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractInherent pore structure of rocks has a significant impact on the acid–rock interaction during the acidizing process. In this study, a new pore-scale reactive transport model applying Darcy–Brinkmann–Stokes method has been developed based on the open-source computational fluid dynamics platform, OpenFOAM, and validated with experimental results. By solving the mass balance equation and advection–diffusion equation, the developed numerical simulation model could capture the evolving pore structure and track the distribution of transported acid. The impacts of different grain sizes and distributions on the dissolution rate of mineral (calcite), evolving porosity, and the transport characteristics of acid have been investigated. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been conducted with respect to the various Damköhler numbers and Péclet numbers in the digital rock image model of Niobrara formation. The changing volume fraction of pores could be categorized into three patterns with different dimensionless numbers—linear growth, pseudo-linear growth, and a flat S-curve growth. The simulation cases of Estaillades carbonate, Massangis Jaune carbonate models, and Sample X segmentation showed that their inherent grain distribution was highly influential on the mineral dissolution rate, where 3-D simulation showed the same results. The developed pore-scale reactive transport model can be applied to various systems with complex pore structures, in order to provide a guidance to predict the system responses such as dissolution rates, surface area, and porosity changes during acidizing in large-scale continuum model.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe study the upscaling of advective pore-scale dispersion in terms of the Eulerian velocity distribution and advective tortuosity, both flow attributes, and of the average pore length, a medium attribute. The stochastic particle motion is modeled as a time-domain random walk, in which particles move along streamlines in equidistant spatial steps with random velocities and thus random transition times. Particle velocities describe stationary spatial Markov processes, which evolve along streamlines on the mean pore length. The streamwise motion is projected onto the mean flow direction using tortuosity. This upscaled stochastic particle model predicts accurately the (non-Fickian) transport dynamics obtained from direct numerical simulations of particle transport in a three-dimensional digitized Berea sandstone sample. It captures all aspects of transport and sheds light on the dependence of the upscaled transport behavior on the flow heterogeneity and the initial particle distribution, which are critical for the accurate modeling of dispersion from the pre-asymptotic to asymptotic regimes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDuring reactive transport modeling, the computing cost associated with chemical equilibrium calculations can be 10 to 10,000 times higher than that of fluid flow, heat transfer, and species transport computations. These calculations are performed at least once per mesh cell and once per time step, amounting to billions of them throughout the simulation employing high-resolution meshes. To radically reduce the computing cost of chemical equilibrium calculations (each requiring an iterative solution of a system of nonlinear equations), we consider an on-demand machine learning algorithm that enables quick and accurate prediction of new chemical equilibrium states using the results of previously solved chemical equilibrium problems within the same reactive transport simulation. The training operations occur on-demand, rather than before the start of the simulation when it is not clear how many training points are needed to accurately and reliably predict all possible chemical conditions that may occur during the simulation. Each on-demand training operation consists of fully solving the equilibrium problem and storing some key information about the just computed chemical equilibrium state (which is used subsequently to rapidly predict similar states whenever possible). We study the performance of the on-demand learning algorithm, which is mass conservative by construction, by applying it to a reactive transport modeling example and achieve a speed-up of one or two orders of magnitude (depending on the activity model used). The implementation and numerical tests are carried out in Reaktoro (reaktoro.org), a unified open-source framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.\n",

      "data_availability_section NotesThe reason for this choice of notation is that we aim to formulate chemical systems in a more general form, instead of one that presumes the existence of certain types of species (e.g., molalities for aqueous solutes, mole fractions for gases, moles for minerals, etc.). We acknowledge that notations used by Lichtner (1985), Steefel and Cappellen (1990), Bethke (2007) are more common in the geochemical community. However, we believe that our choice for dependent and independent variables (molar amounts for all species, no matter their type, and considering elements as the building blocks of species, instead of primary/basic species) should not be difficult to understand.When A is full rank, the number of primary species and elements (i.e., chemical elements and electric charge) are equal.AcknowledgementsThis research project is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Ambizione Grant PZ00P2-179967) and Shell Global Solutions International BV (Netherlands).

      "abstract AbstractFour types of voids exist in shale, including inorganic pores, organic pores, natural fractures, and hydraulic fractures, where the gas flow within is affected by voids sizes, shapes, and the mineral composition surrounding them. It is still a challenge to build an effective multi-scale model for shale by now. A model classifying organic pores and inorganic pores with and without clay was proposed in our previous work by incorporating various testing methods. However, some improvements can be made, including wider the pore size of the model to full-scale and adding the fractures without being considered previously. Therefore, a new model is proposed by integrating an improved full-scale matrix pore network model (PNM) with fractures. That is, the effects of four types of voids, including organic pores, inorganic pores containing clay, inorganic pores without clay, and fractures, on gas flow are all considered in the model. Then, the factors affecting the permeability of the matrix (i.e., without fractures) and the whole model (i.e., with fractures) were analyzed. The results show that connectivity both in small- and large-scale PNM and total organic content facilitate the flow, while clay content and water film thickness hinder the flow, especially within small pores. Fractures along the pressure drop accelerate gas flow, and the fractures perpendicular to the pressure drop only channel the pressure when the fractures along the pressure drop both exist. The model can be applied to other mudstones and shales and studies the fluid migration within them through proper parameters adjustment.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, the geometrically nonlinear thermally induced vibration response of beams made of porous functionally graded materials (FGMs) under thermal shock is investigated using a novel numerical approach. The material properties are considered to be temperature- and position-dependent. It is also assumed that the beams are embedded in an elastic medium which is considered as Winkler–Pasternak type. Hamilton’s principle, the Timoshenko beam theory and the von Kármán geometrical nonlinear assumptions are used to derive the equations of motion. The matrix representation of relations is given that can be efficiently utilized in numerical approaches. Solution in time domain is done using the Newmark algorithm according to the constant average acceleration technique. In the space domain, the generalized differential quadrature and variational differential quadrature (VDQ) methods are employed for discretization. Using VDQ leads to compact/efficient vector–matrix relations which can be readily utilized in the coding process. The numerical results are presented to analyze the effects of power law index, boundary conditions, material porosity, elastic foundation and length-to-thickness ratio on the nonlinear thermally induced vibrations of FGM porous beams. It is shown that considering the even distribution, the vibration amplitude of beams decreases as the porosity volume fraction gets larger, while it increases for the uneven distribution. Moreover, the time required to reach the steady state of vibrations increases with increasing the power law index of FGM.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid blobs in an immiscible Newtonian fluid flowing in a capillary tube with varying radius show highly nonlinear behavior. We consider here a generalization of previously obtained results to blobs of non-Newtonian fluids. We compute here the yield pressure drop and the mean flow rate in two cases: (i) When a single blob is injected, (ii) When many blobs are randomly injected into the tube. We find that the capillary effects emerge from the non-uniformity of the tube radius and contribute to the threshold pressure for flow to occur. Furthermore, in the presence of many blobs the threshold value depends on the number of blobs and their relative distances which are randomly distributed. For a capillary fiber bundle of identical parallel tubes, we calculate the probability distribution of the threshold pressure and the mean flow rate. We consider two geometries: tubes of sinusoidal shape, for which we derive explicit expressions, and triangular-shaped tubes, for which we find that essential singularities are developed. We perform numerical simulations confirming our analytical results.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPressure reduction following uplift may lead to dissociation of gas hydrates. The dynamics of hydrate dissociation in such settings, however, are poorly understood. We used TOUGH+HYDRATE to investigate the response of gas hydrates to an uplift of 0.009 myr\\(^{-1}\\) over the last 8 kyrs, the approximate end of the postglacial sea-level rise. Geological parameters for the simulations are based on hydrate deposits from the Nankai Trough subduction zone. Our results suggest stabilisation from endothermic cooling, elevated pore pressure, and pore water freshening significantly slows hydrate dissociation such that the hydrate remains in place at its pre-uplift level. A shallower hydrate layer forms from upward-migrating gas when assuming moderate to high permeability (10\\(^{-15}\\) and 10\\(^{-13}\\) m\\(^{2}\\)), while gas remains trapped for low permeability (10\\(^{-17}\\) m\\(^{2}\\)). In the latter case, we predict elevated pore pressure with potential implications for seafloor stability. Our findings suggest that following uplift, hydrates may exist outside the predicted regional gas hydrate stability field for thousands of years.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA macroscopic model that accounts for the effect of momentum dispersion on flows in porous media is proposed. The model is based on the pore scale prevalence hypothesis (PSPH). The effects of macroscopic velocity gradient on momentum transport are approximated using a Laplacian term. A local Reynolds number Red, which characterizes the strength of momentum dispersion, is introduced to calculate the effective viscosity. The characteristic length used in defining Red is the pore size, while the characteristic velocity is the mixing velocity. A Taylor expansion is made for the effective viscosity with respect to Red. The two leading-order terms of the Taylor series are adopted in the present PSPH momentum-dispersion model. The model constants are determined from the direct numerical simulation results of a flow in the same porous medium bounded by two walls. The effective viscosity approaches the molecular viscosity when the porosity is increased to 1. It approaches infinity when the porosity approaches 0. The benchmark studies show that the effects of the macroscopic velocity gradient can be approximated by the Laplacian term. The proposed PSPH momentum-dispersion model is highly accurate in a wide range of Reynolds and Darcy numbers as well as porosities.\n",

      "abstract Abstract The interaction between the fluid flow and the deformable porous media is crucial in the applications of adsorption/absorption. The immersed boundary coupled lattice Boltzmann method is used in this study. The spring constant k of porous skeleton is introduced to consider the deformation effects. Subsequently, the evolutions of deformation of porous skeleton and hydrodynamic characteristics of fluid with k and Reynolds number are elucidated. The trend of deformation of porous skeleton appears as “concave front and convex back.” Moreover, the porosity of deformable porous media decreases gradually with the deformation growing. Meanwhile, the resistance of fluid flow increases due to the growing deformation of the porous skeleton. The larger k and Re contribute to the smaller drag coefficient. The deformation of the porous skeleton accelerates the detachment of the fluid boundary layer, and vortex patterns transfer from 2S to 2P mode with Reynolds number increasing when k = 0.05. Larger deformation leads to the higher pressure drop. The pressure drop for k = 0.01 is 21.7% higher than k = 0.05.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe consider heat transport within a discontinuous domain by relying on the modeling approach proposed by Baioni et al. Such approach has been specifically designed to address diffusive processes in media with discontinuous physical properties and generalized boundary conditions at the discontinuities. Three algorithms are here applied to estimate the conductive heat transport in a bimaterial medium. The algorithms undergo testing using two test cases that share the same computational domain but differ in terms of their initial conditions. According to the numerical results all the algorithms ensure the conservation of thermal energy and preserve thermal equilibrium under steady state conditions. The Generalized Uffink Method (GUM) and Generalized HYMLA demonstrate sensitivity to the choice of the time step, whereas the Generalized Skew Brownian Motion appears to be unaffected by the value of \\(\\Delta t\\). The GUM algorithm presents an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational time.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEvaporation from a porous medium partially saturated with saline water, causes the salinity (salt concentration) to increase near the top of the porous medium as water leaves while salt stays behind. As the density of the water increases with increased salt concentration, the evaporation leads to a gravitational unstable setting, where density instabilities can form. Whether density instabilities form, depends on a large range of parameters like the evaporation rate and intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, but also on the water saturation. As water saturation decreases, the storage, convection and diffusion of salt also decrease, which all influence the onset of instabilities. By performing a linear stability analysis on the governing equations, we give criteria for onset of instabilities, with a particular focus on impact of saturation. While decreased storage and diffusion make onset of instabilities more unstable, decreased convection has a stabilizing effect on the onset of instabilities. We find that their combined influence is that lower saturation overall gives earlier onset times. Numerical simulations give information about the further development of these instabilities. With this knowledge we can predict whether and when density instabilities occur, and how they will influence the further development of salt concentration in the porous medium.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe develop an innovative mixed-dimensional 3D/1D flow model in carbonate rocks containing multiple karst cave conduits with underlying heterogeneity in the petrophysical properties stemming from different geological stages of cave-pipe collapse systems. Such geological structures manifest in distinct heterogeneity patterns inherent to the successive stages of burial, mechanical failure, and collapse, resulting in discrete collapsed passages in the conduit network. In addition, breakdown products appear within the cave system associated with chaotic breccia, suprastrata deformation, and vertical tube-like geo-bodies, herein referred to as breccia pipes, containing faults and fractures around the vertical pipe. The input parameters of the mixed-dimensional flow model show the ability to incorporate the complex multiple heterogeneities associated with the geological objects at different stages of collapse. After populating the geo-bodies with proper petrophysical properties, the mixed-dimensional flow equations are discretized by a locally conservative extended version of the mixed-hybrid finite element method, which incorporates the new nonlinear discrete transmission jump conditions between elements adjacent to the breccias within the conduits. Computational simulations are performed for particular configurations of heterogeneous karst conduit systems with distinct geological time scales, illustrating the influence of the karst and solution breccia-pipe deposits upon the flow regimes, streamline patterns, and well productivity in real-case scenarios of hypogenic cave networks.\n",

      "abstract Abstract We devise a new computational model to describe numerically the coarse-scale response of coupled conduit/matrix flow in karstified carbonate rocks. The methodology is based on the combination of a two-scale coupled 1D/3D flow model, rigorously derived by formal homogenization, and an extension of the recursive Mixed Multiscale Method (MuMM), seated on domain decomposition and redesigned herein to more complex bi-modal systems. Within this double-coarsening framework, our target macroscopic scenario consists of a limestone matrix intertwined by a network of karst-conduits of high aspect ratio between longitudinal length and hydraulic diameter. In order to upscale the high-fidelity flow equations to a mesoscale model characterized by the presence of 1D sub-manifolds, associated with the conduit network, embedded in the 3D carbonate matrix, we proceed within a model reduction seated on matched asymptotic expansions. Such an upscaling leads to the appearance of an exchange function described by a line-source $$\\delta$$ δ -function localized in the coordinates intercepted by the conduit network. Subsequently, the extended multiscale method is constructed to numerically capture the macroscopic response of the karstified medium by properly designing multiscale basis functions for the mixed formulation of the reduced problem, adapted to the scenario with presence of the local conduit/matrix exchange functions, numerically approximated by a local regularization of the $$\\delta$$ δ -function. Within the framework of the recursive multiscale domain decomposition methodology, the coarse-grid interface problem, which assembles the local solutions, is replaced by the family of small localized interface linear systems obtained by the clustering of the multiscale basis functions associated with the nearest neighbor subdomains. Parallel implementation of the recursive procedure proposed herein exhibits good efficiency and scalability properties, showing great potential for the resolution of giant karstified reservoirs containing up to billions of cells. Computational simulations are performed considering a particular karst arrangement of branchwork-type in the sense of the pioneering work of Palmer (Geol Soc Am Bull 103: 1–21, 1991). To assess the quality of the coarser-scale multiscale solutions, numerical results of pressure and velocity fields are computed and compared with a reference solution computed by the mixed-hybrid finite element method adopting fine meshes. Article Highlights A reduced 1D/3D coupled model is constructed within the framework of formal homogenization for flow in karst conduits. The recursive multiscale mixed method is further explored to obtain coarse-scale accurate resolution of the reduced model. Numerical results show reliability of the coupled lower-dimensional reduced/multiscale approach.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe developed a relative permeability (kr) model using an artificial neural network (ANN) that can simultaneously fit one or more drainage and imbibition experimental scans while also predicting relative permeability and residual saturations for other scans. The ANN model uses saturation and phase connectivity and is constrained to giving continuous and physical values for any hysteresis path. The new model can estimate continuous kr values even when saturations move outside residual saturation limits owing to vaporization or solubilization. To demonstrate the approach, we fit one measured drainage and imbibition kr curve from gas–water experimental data to develop contours of kr in saturation-connectivity space. Relative permeability is then predicted as paths, described by simple functions, are traversed. The results show that residual saturations vary automatically as small kr values are encountered and increase with increasing initial saturation without the use of Land’s model. The ANN model simultaneously fits all experimental data, unlike current empirical Corey or hysteresis models. Once tuned, the ANN model accurately predicts other measured hysteresis scans not used in tuning.\n",

      "abstract AbstractModified or low-salinity waterflooding of carbonate oil reservoirs is of considerable economic interest because of potentially inexpensive incremental oil production. The injected modified brine changes the surface chemistry of the carbonate rock and crude oil interfaces and detaches some of adhered crude oil. Composition design of brine modified to enhance oil recovery is determined by labor-intensive trial-and-error laboratory corefloods. Unfortunately, limestone, which predominantly consists of aqueous-reactive calcium carbonate, alters injected brine composition by mineral dissolution/precipitation. Accordingly, the rock reactivity hinders rational design of brines tailored to improve oil recovery. Previously, we presented a theoretical analysis of 1D, single-phase brine injection into calcium carbonate-rock that accounts for mineral dissolution, ion exchange, and dispersion (Yutkin et al. in SPE J 23(01):084–101, 2018. https://doi.org/10.2118/182829-PA). Here, we present the results of single-phase waterflood-brine experiments that verify the theoretical framework. We show that concentration histories eluted from Indiana limestone cores possess features characteristic of fast calcium carbonate dissolution, 2:1 ion exchange, and high dispersion. The injected brine reaches chemical equilibrium inside the porous rock even at injection rates higher than 3.5 \\(\\times\\) 10\\(^{-3}\\) m s\\(^{-1}\\) (1000 ft/day). Ion exchange results in salinity waves observed experimentally, while high dispersion is responsible for long concentration history tails. Using the verified theoretical framework, we briefly explore how these processes modify aqueous-phase composition during the injection of designer brines into a calcium-carbonate reservoir. Because of high salinity of the initial and injected brines, ion exchange affects injected concentrations only in high surface area carbonates/limestones, such as chalks. Calcium-carbonate dissolution only affects aqueous solution pH. The rock surface composition is affected by all processes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid flow through layered materials with different wetting behavior is observed in a wide range of applications in biological, environmental and technical systems. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the occuring transport mechanisms of the fluids at the interface between the layered constituents. Of special interest is the water transport in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Here, it is necessary to understand the transport mechanisms of water throughout the cell constituents especially on the cathode side, where the excess water has to be removed. This is crucial to choose optimal operating conditions and improve the overall cell performance. Pore-scale modeling of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and gas distributor has been established as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes. Investigating the interface between the hydrophobic porous GDL and the hydrophilic gas distributor, a particular challenge is the combination and interaction of the different material structures and wetting properties at the interface and its influence on the flow. In this paper, a modeling approach is presented which captures the influence of a hydrophilic domain on the flow in a hydrophobic porous domain at the interface between the two domains. A pore-network model is used as the basis of the developed concept which is extended to allow the modeling of mixed-wet interactions at the interface. The functionality of the model is demonstrated using basic example configurations with one and several interface pores and it is applied to a realistic GDL representation in contact with a channel-land structured gas distributor.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTraditionally, steady-state relative permeability is calculated from measurements on small rock samples using Darcy’s law and assuming a homogenous saturation profile and constant capillary pressure. However, these assumptions are rarely correct as local inhomogeneities exist; furthermore, the wetting phase tends to be retained at the outlet–the so-called capillary end effect. We have introduced a new method that corrects the relative permeabilities, analytically, for an inhomogeneous saturation profile along the flow direction. The only data required are the measured pressure drops for different fractional flow values, an estimate of capillary pressure, and the saturation profiles. An optimization routine is applied to find the range of relative permeability values consistent with the uncertainty in the measured pressure. Assuming a homogenous saturation profile systematically underestimates the relative permeability and this effect is most marked for media where one of the phases is strongly wetting with a noticeable capillary end effect. Relative permeabilities from seven two-phase flow experiments in centimetre-scale samples with different wettability were corrected while reconciling some hitherto apparently contradictory results. We reproduce relative permeabilities of water-wet Bentheimer sandstone that are closer to other measurements in the literature on larger samples than the original analysis. Furthermore, we find that the water relative permeability during waterflooding a carbonate sample with a wide range of pore sizes can be high, due to good connectivity through the microporosity. For mixed-wet media with lower capillary pressure and less variable saturation profiles, the corrections are less significant.\n",

The evaluation procedure and convergence properties are discussed. To validate the solution, we compare it against a numerical solution using second-order finite differences in a parametric study. Our results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the analytical solution, making it a valuable tool for testing numerical schemes for discrete fracture-matrix models.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA microscale modelling framework to compute effective properties related to flow, heat and mass transfer during vacuum cooling (VC) of porous foods was developed. A heterogeneous computational domain reconstructed from steamed bread (SB) was used for modelling, while the cellular water transport in SB investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance was applied for model validation. The computed porosity (63.47 ± 1.05%), effective permeability (1.91 ± 0.39 × 10−11 m2), effective thermal conductivity, (0.33 ± 0.08 W m−1 K−1), and effective diffusivity (5.56 ×  ± 0.24 10−8 m2 s−1) were in the same range as those measured from the experiment/literature. Also, the analysis revealed that microstructural variability significantly affected the estimated effective properties. The microscale model yielded results similar to the lumped formulation but provided details not visible in the latter. Therefore, the developed model provides a framework for multiscale modelling, which could lead to a better understanding of the underlying moisture loss mechanisms during VC.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Reservoir modeling consists of two key components: the reproduction of the historical performance and the prediction of the future reservoir performance. Industry-standard reservoir simulators must run fast on enormous and possibly unstructured grids while yet guaranteeing a reasonable representation of physical and chemical processes. However, computational demands limit simulators in capturing involved physical and geochemical mechanisms, especially when chemical reactions interfere with reservoir flow. This paper presents a mathematical workflow, implemented in IORSim, that makes it possible to add geochemical calculations to porous media flow simulators without access to the source code of the original host simulator. An industry-standard reservoir simulator calculates velocity fields of the fluid phases (e.g., water, oil, and gas), while IORSim calculates the transport and reaction of geochemical components. Depending on the simulation mode, the geochemical solver estimates updated relative and/or capillary pressure curves to modify the global fluid flow. As one of the key innovations of the coupling mechanism, IORSim uses a sorting algorithm to permute the grid cells along flow directions. Instead of solving an over-dimensionalized global matrix calling a Newton–Raphson solver, the geochemical software tool treats the species balance as a set of local nonlinear problems. Moreover, IORSim applies basis swapping and splay tree techniques to accelerate geochemical computations in complex full-field reservoir models. The presented work introduces the mathematical IORSim concept, verifies the chemical species advection, and demonstrates the IORSim computation efficiency. After validating the geochemical solver against reference software, IORSim is used to investigate the impact of seawater injection on the NCS Ekofisk reservoir chemistry. Article Highlights The IORSim sorting algorithm decouples the nonlinear geochemical reaction calculations into recurring one-dimensional problems to assure numerical stability and computation efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the mathematical concept, implementation, and application of topological sorting for the first time on (industry) field-scale problems. IORSim combines topological sorting with basis swapping and splay trees to significantly reduce computation times. Moreover, a high-speed forward simulation mode was developed to allow the post-advection of chemical components to visualize species distribution, water chemistry, and mineral interactions. If the geochemical reactions interfere with the fluid flow, the IORSim backward mode uses relative permeability curves to update the global fluid flow at each time step. We validate the implemented topological scheme on a reservoir grid, show the computation efficiency, and compare the impact of explicit, implicit, and grid refinement on numerical dispersion. The decoupled flow simulator and geochemical reaction calculations allow seamless integration of full-field reservoir models that contain complex geological structures, a large number of wells, and long production histories. The computation capabilities of IORSim are demonstrated by simulating and reproducing the impact of seawater injection in the southern segment of the giant Ekofisk field (more than 50 years of injection and production history). IORSim shows that seawater injection changed the Ekofisk mineralogy and impacted the produced water chemistry. In the investigated Ekofisk case, seawater promoted calcite dissolution and led to the precipitation of magnesite and anhydrite. Moreover, surface complexation modeling revealed that sulfate is adsorbed on the calcite surface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWavelets are localized small waves that exhibit the characteristic oscillatory behavior of waves with an amplitude that declines rapidly to zero. Their properties include orthogonality or bi-orthogonality, a natural multiresolution and, often, compact support. These properties can be used to repeatedly rescale a signal or a function, decomposing it to a desirable level, and obtaining and preserving trend and detail data at all scales that allow re-composition of the original signal. The overall goal of this work is to create a set of wavelet-based (WB) numerical methods using different wavelet bases for application to the solution of the PDEs of interest to petroleum engineering, namely the solution of the PDEs of fluid flow through porous and fractured media. A particular emphasis of the study is in processes associated with ultra-low permeability media such as shale oil and shale gas reservoirs. To address the problem, we developed WTFS (wavelet transform flow simulator), a new flow simulator written in MATLAB that couples wavelet transform with a standard finite-difference scheme. In the current state of development, the WB numerical solution is verified against analytical solutions of 1D problems for liquid flow through porous media and is validated through comparisons to numerical solutions for problems of 2D and 3D flow through porous media obtained from a conventional numerical simulator.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPorous media characterization is crucial to engineering projects where the pore shape has impact on performance gains. Membrane filters, sportswear fabrics, and tertiary oil recovery are a few examples. Kozeny–Carman (K–C) models are one of the most frequently used to understand, for instance, the relation between porosity, permeability, and other small-scale parameters. However, they have limitations, such as the inability to capture the correct dependence of permeability on porosity, the imperfect handling of the linear and nonlinear effects yielded by its fundamental quantities, and the insufficiency of geometrical parameters to predict the permeability correctly. In this paper, we cope with the problem of determining shape factors for generic geometries that represent sundry porous media configurations. Specifically, we propose a method that embeds the Poiseuille number into the classical K–C equation and returns a substitute shape factor term for its original counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, the existing formulations are unable to obtain shape factors for pores whose geometry is beyond the regular ones. We apply a Galerkin-based integral (GBI) method that determines shape factors for generic cross sections of pore channels. The approach is tested on straight capillaries with arbitrary cross sections subject to steady single-phase flow under the laminar regime. We show that shape factors for basic geometries known from experimental results are replicable exactly. Besides, we provide shape factors with precision up to 4 digits for a class of geometries of interest. As a way to demonstrate the applicability of the GBI approach, we report a case study that determines shape factors for 19 generic individual pore sections of a laboratory experiment involving flow rate measurements in an industrial arrangement of a water-agar packed bed. Porosity, flow behavior, and velocity distributions determined numerically achieve a narrow agreement with experimental values. The findings of this study provide parameters that can help to design new devices or mechanisms that depend on arbitrary pore shapes, as well as to characterize fluid flows in heterogeneous porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany subsurface formations, such as soils, carbonate rocks, and mudstones, possess multiscale pore structures that impose significant challenges to the pore-scale modeling of flow and transport processes. Despite the development of several models, there is a lack of comparative studies and quantitative analysis to evaluate their performance. In this work, we present two image-based hybrid models for predicting absolute permeability and electrical formation factor: a dual-pore-network model (DPNM) and a pore-network-continuum model (PNCM). We use several publicly available digital rock samples of Estaillades carbonate, one of which includes experimentally characterized sub-resolution regions (i.e., microporosity) represented by 3D maps of porosity and entry pressure. We perform comprehensive comparisons between the DPNM and PNCM, focusing on the strengths and limitations of the DPNM. Our results show that, assuming homogeneous microporosity, both the DPNM and PNCM accurately predict absolute permeability and formation factors. However, for realistic heterogeneous microporosity, the DPNM significantly underestimates absolute permeability by more than an order of magnitude, compared to the PNCM. We also explore two methods to improve the performance of our DPNM. Our findings will provide a foundation for the application of DPNMs to a wide range of geological and engineering systems.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMuch of the continental margins in the world oceans provide the necessary thermodynamic conditions to store CO\\(_2\\) as ice-like hydrates (CO\\(_2\\cdot\\)6 H\\(_2\\)O). While resistant to buoyant migration and leakage, the fundamental growth mechanisms that control the injection, capacity, and security of CO\\(_2\\) hydrates stored in the seafloor remain unresolved. Extensive field and laboratory testing give rise to conflicting views on the kinetics and growth configurations of hydrates, where mechanistic models reconciling the formation of hydrates observed in nature remain missing. This work elucidates a fundamental pore-scale reactive transport mechanism that underpins the rate and morphology of hydrate formation. We reveal a previously unrecognized mode of hydrate formation in porous seafloor sediments, hydrate film growth via reaction-imbibition, where superhydrophilic hydrate crystallites (\\(\\theta \\sim 0^\\circ\\)) formed at water–CO\\(_2\\) interfaces create a secondary microporous medium (\\(\\sim\\) 10 to 100 nm pores) within lithologic sediment pores (\\(\\sim\\) 10 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)m pores) to promote further hydrate growth. Unlike past diffusion-controlled models, we show that spontaneous water imbibition into the hydrate micropores establishes rapidly new water–CO\\(_2\\) interfaces (i.e., hydrate formation surfaces) via capillary-driven convection and is the dominant mechanism for supplying water to the hydrate formation interface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractProper characterization of the mechanical and flow properties of participating rock formations is crucial for subsurface geo-energy projects, including hydrocarbon extraction, geologic carbon storage, and enhanced geothermal systems. Application of mechanical and hydraulic pressures changes the porosity of rock and modifies flow paths. For low-permeable or “tight” rock that mainly contains nanoscale pores and serves as the confining layer for underground storage operations, a significant change in permeability may occur due to a small change in porosity. The pore volume changes in nanoporous geomaterials are extremely difficult to measure directly, but can be assessed from the knowledge of the hydro-mechanical response. Experimental methods to measure the stress-dependent permeability and poroelastic parameters of fluid-saturated tight rock are introduced. Eau Claire shale, Opalinus clay (claystone), and Charcoal granite are selected as representative materials for tight rock and their pore structure and material properties are carefully investigated. The porosity–permeability relationship for tight rock is established by adopting a power-law dependence with the exponent value in the range of 15–17, thus being significantly larger than that for a porous reservoir rock. Consequently, even small perturbations of porosity can cause orders of magnitude changes in permeability possessing a risk on the sealing capacity of the tight formations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFormulation of an effective stress equation for unsaturated soils where all relevant physical characteristics are included has challenged researchers for several decades. On one hand, the interfacial forces and the contractile skin have recently been understood to be of significant contribution to the effective stress, particularly at low degrees of saturation. On the other hand, the microstructural effects play a significant role, especially in fine-grained soils. In this study, an equation is proposed for the effective stress parameter (\\(\\chi\\)) based on the recent advances in modeling the adsorbed water, and thereby determining the capillary water retention curves. In the proposed relationship, both the microstructural effect and interfacial forces are taken into account. Additionally, in formulating effective stress, these two aforementioned aspects have been considered and formulated for both drying and wetting conditions. To this end, the interfacial forces were determined based on the capillary water content. Next, the proposed model was further simplified to reduce the number of unknown parameters to one with the rest of the parameters readily available from the soil water retention curve. The simplified formulation agrees fairly well when compared with the experimental data on soils experiencing both drying and wetting paths. Furthermore, assessing the performance of the proposed model, compared with the available equations incorporating the contribution of the interfacial forces, indicates the superiority of the proposed model for the eight soil types examined in this study.\n",

Solutions to the homogeneous parts of these equations are given in terms of Airy’s and Weber’s special functions. Particular solutions to the resulting inhomogeneous equations give rise to three Nield-Kuznetsov functions of the first kind, which are analyzed in this work and extended to obtain general solutions to equations with variable forcing terms whose general solutions are expressed in terms of three Nield-Kuznetsov functions of the second kind.

      "abstract AbstractWith hydraulic fracturing technology, manmade fractures can be generated around the shale-gas wells. After hydraulic fracturing at each fracture stage, many wells in shale reservoirs have the “shut-in” process, which provides many precious data for parameter estimation. But, owing to intricate geological and engineering factors, the fractures in reservoirs are asymmetric and heterogeneous, which brings a great challenge for fracture estimation. To improve this situation, coupling with deep learning (DL) approach and experimental practices, we established a surrogate model for non-uniform fractures at one fracture stage, based on deep Bi-directional LSTM model. First, a well testing model containing three distinct flow regions is developed, namely (1) heterogeneous hydraulic fractures, (2) the inner region affected by hydraulic fracturing, and (3) the outer region without stimulation. Laplace transformation methods are used for model solutions. Then, with the model solutions, a surrogate model based on deep bidirectional LSTM is built for improving computational efficiency. Compared with the proxy model based on LSTM, RNN and ANN, Bi-LSTM model can effectively reduce the early prediction error of pressure derivative, and the average relative prediction error is 1.16%. The pressure transient behavior of the surrogate model can be divided into four flow regimes, which represent bilinear flow, interporosity flow, linear flow and boundary dominated flow, respectively. Finally, model verification was shown by comparing with the results from traditional well testing model. The results show that the calculation speed of the surrogate model is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the well test model. The findings of this study can help to efficiently evaluate the fracture parameter in complex fracture system generated by large-scale fracturing treatments in shale reservoirs.\n",

The porous bed is modelled as cubic and staggered packings of mono-radii circular obstructions where the bed porosity is varied by altering the circle radii. The results for the macroscopic properties are validated using previously published results. For unsteady flows, it is found that one unit cell is not enough to represent all structures of the fluid flow which substantially impacts the permeability and dispersive properties of the porous bed. In the steady region, a single unit cell is shown to accurately represent the fluid flow across all cases studied\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe linear stability analysis of Darcy–Brinkman–Bénard convection (DBBC) in a binary fluid-saturated porous layer is studied numerically using \\(n\\) term Galerkin approach for rigid–rigid, isothermal boundaries. The occupied binary fluid and porous medium are assumed to be in thermal non-equilibrium. Thus, two energy equations are used for each phase. The critical values of the Darcy–Rayleigh and wave numbers for the onset of convection are obtained by considering ten terms in the Galerkin solution. The effect of the five parameters of the model, namely the Darcy number, Da, the modified ratio of thermal conductivity \\(\\gamma\\), the Lewis number Le, the separation ratio coefficient, \\(\\chi\\), and the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, H, on the stability of the system is discussed in detail and presented with the aid of plots and tables. The onset of convection in a binary fluid-saturated porous medium is delayed for realistic boundary conditions compared with ideal boundary conditions (stress-free, isothermal boundary conditions). Increasing the values of the Darcy number, inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, and the separation ratio coefficient stabilizes DBBC. In contrast, the thermal conductivity ratio and Lewis number are destabilize the system. Furthermore, convective cell size remains unaltered with increasing \\(\\chi\\). Convection is delayed in the pure fluid medium compared to the binary fluid medium. Local thermal non-equilibrium ceases for small and large inter-phase heat transfer coefficient values.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe onset of thermal convection in two-dimensional porous cavities heated from below is studied theoretically. An open (constant-pressure) boundary is assumed, with zero perturbation temperature (thermally conducting). The resulting eigenvalue problem is a full fourth-order problem without degeneracies. Numerical results are presented for rectangular and elliptical cavities, with the circle as a special case. The analytical solution for an upright rectangle confirms the numerical results. Streamlines penetrating the open cavities are plotted, together with the isotherms for the associated closed thermal cells. Isobars forming pressure cells are depicted for the perturbation pressure. The critical Rayleigh number is calculated as a function of geometric parameters, including the tilt angle of the rectangle and ellipse. An improved physical scaling of the Darcy–Bénard problem is suggested. Its significance is indicated by the ratio of maximal vertical velocity to maximal temperature perturbation.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe adequate management of the damage caused by effective permeability loss in stress-sensitive reservoirs becomes essential to productivity maintenance. This paper proposes a new unsteady-state poroelastic solution for the nonlinear hydraulic diffusivity equation in Biot’s effective stress-sensitive reservoirs fully penetrated by fractured oil wells. The hydraulic fracture in the proposed mathematical modeling is finite with tip effects and crosses the whole reservoir net pay. The NHDE is expanded in a first-order asymptotic series, and a poroelastic integro-differential solution coupled with a Green’s function (GF) is used to represent the source/sink term. A set of pore pressure and permeability data is used from geomechanical literature and transformed into effective stress through Biot’s equation. The effect of the Biot’s coefficient, overburden stress, oil flow rate, fracture’s tip, and proppant porosity arrangements is simulated. The results show that these parameters are essential to minimize formation damage. The accuracy, ease of implementation, and low computational costs constitute the main advantages of the model addressed in this paper. Hence, it may be a valuable and attractive mathematical tool to identify flow regimes, providing permeability loss control and supporting well–reservoir management. Hence, the proposed modeling becomes a useful and attractive tool for forecasting and monitoring permeability loss, oil flow rate specification, and reservoir history matching.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe partial differential equations describing immiscible, but soluble, carbon dioxide (CO2) displacement of brine in saline storage formations are developed including mass transfer across the CO2–brine interface. Scaling relationships for characteristic time among laboratory and representative storage formation conditions are found upon assumption that free-phase CO2 transport during injection is dominated by pressure-driven flow. The implication is that an hour in the FluidFlower (room-scale visual model) scales to hundreds of years of elapsed time in the storage formation. The scaling criteria permit extrapolation of the effects of changes in parameters and operating conditions. Interphase mass transfer allows CO2 to saturate the brine phase and the finite time of such mass transfer results in substantial time to approach equilibrium. Significant mixing of CO2 dissolved into formation brine with original brine is found experimentally and is also predicted. The magnitude of onset time for buoyancy-driven fingers that enhance mixing of CO2 is typically only a fraction of the duration of CO2 injection and in general agreement with theoretical analysis in the literature. Predictions for onset time of convective mixing at representative storage formation conditions, likewise, teach that the onset time for fingering is significantly less than the duration of CO2 injection in some cases. The implications of this observation include that mixing of CO2 with brine and the subsequent settling due to gravity are relatively rapid and coincide with the period of active CO2 injection.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe fundamental characteristic of a semi-permeable porous material is that the solvent is allowed to pass through it but the solute is not. Due to this characteristic, a solute concentration gradient can drive chemical osmosis flow in the solution-saturated semi-permeable porous material. Although analytical solutions have been derived for one-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems, computational simulations of two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems remain lacking to date. To fill this gap, a new mathematical model is first established, in this paper, for describing two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems in solution-saturated semi-permeable porous materials. Then a computational simulation procedure, which contains the finite difference and finite element methods, is proposed to solve the partial differential equations involved in the established mathematical model. For the purpose of verifying the proposed computational simulation procedure, the analytical solution of a benchmark problem has been derived mathematically. The related computational simulation results have demonstrated that: (1) the proposed computational simulation procedure is correct and accurate for solving chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems; and (2) the applied boundary conditions have significant effects on the computational simulation results of two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems in the solution-saturated semi-permeable porous material.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTo characterise the sorption behaviour of wood or other hygroscopic materials with the use of water vapour sorption experiments, an accurate understanding of water vapour transport both to and through the sample material is necessary. Within the last decades, various modelling approaches on the sorption kinetics were developed, but there seems to be no general agreement on the relevance of water vapour transport. Using small amounts of grained wood, this study aims to estimate the influence of water vapour transport in sorption experiments on small sample sizes. A theoretical analysis based on a diffusion equation including a simplified sink/source term was carried out and compared with corresponding experiments. Nonlinear isotherm and temperature were shown to have a major impact on the effective diffusion of water vapour, whereas step size in humidity seems to mainly influence processes within the cell wall (e.g. relaxation and reorganisation of microstructure). Considering the paths of stagnant air above sample surface, the anomalous behaviour for a variation in sample thickness of grained wood can be explained. In conclusion, water vapour transport appreciably influences the sorption kinetics of small sample sizes and has to be considered in the modelling and interpretation of water vapour sorption experiments.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe study transport of passive tracers by plane laminar flows with stagnation points. This setup serves as a simple model of transport in porous media. Close to stagnation points, the flow velocity is much lower than on the average. Many experimental data disclose that transport through porous media is slower than predictions of the standard advection-diffusion model. Commonly, in descriptions of flows through porous media the heterogeneity of flow is disregarded, and some average velocity is adopted. To model regular arrays of flow patterns with stagnation points, we employ the construction of special flow: a combination of mapping and a sort of ceiling function with singularity. We show that, depending on the type of stagnation points, many experimentally established effects can be reproduced. This includes the linear sorption, usually described by the standard MIM model, as well as subdiffusion, described by the fractional MIM model. We also show that slow molecular diffusion does not eliminate the effects of the transport slowdown.\n",

The side walls of the cavity are heated and cooled by constant heat fluxes, while the horizontal walls are adiabatic. The governing parameters for the problem are thermal Rayleigh number, R, the aspect ratio of the cavity, A, and the variable permeability constant, c. On the basis of the Darcy–Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations, a new analytical solution is developed in the limit of a long shallow cavity. A numerical study of the same phenomenon, obtained by solving the complete system of governing equations, is conducted to assess the validity of the analytical results.

      "abstract AbstractWe study immiscible two-phase flow of a compressible and an incompressible fluid inside a capillary tube of varying radius under steady-state conditions. The incompressible fluid is Newtonian and the compressible fluid is an inviscid ideal gas. The surface tension associated with the interfaces between the two fluids introduces capillary forces that vary along the tube due to the variation in the tube radius. The interplay between effects due to the capillary forces and the compressibility results in a set of properties that are different from incompressible two-phase flow. As the fluids move towards the outlet, the bubbles of the compressible fluid grows in volume due to the decrease in pressure. The volumetric growth of the compressible bubbles makes the volumetric flow rate at the outlet higher than at the inlet. The growth is not only a function of the pressure drop across the tube, but also of the ambient pressure. Furthermore, the capillary forces create an effective threshold below which there is no flow. Above the threshold, the system shows a weak nonlinearity between the flow rates and the effective pressure drop, where the nonlinearity also depends on the absolute pressures across the tube.\n",

      "abstract AbstractConvolution neural networks (CNNs) are well-suited to model the nonlinear relationship between the microscale geometry of porous media and the corresponding flow distribution, thereby accurately and efficiently coupling the flow behavior at the micro- and macroscale levels. In this paper, we have identified the challenges involved in implementing CNNs for macroscale model closure in the turbulent flow regime, particularly in the prediction of the drag force components arising from the microscale level. We report that significant error is incurred in the crucial data preparation step when the Reynolds averaged pressure and velocity distributions are interpolated from unstructured stretched grids used for large eddy simulation (LES) to the structured uniform grids used by the CNN model. We show that the range of the microscale velocity values is 10 times larger than the range of the pressure values. This invalidates the use of the mean squared error loss function to train the CNN model for multivariate prediction. We have developed a CNN model framework that addresses these challenges by proposing a conservative interpolation method and a normalized mean squared error loss function. We simulated a model dataset to train the CNN for turbulent flow prediction in periodic porous media composed of cylindrical solid obstacles with square cross-section by varying the porosity in the range 0.3 to 0.88. We demonstrate that the resulting CNN model predicts the pressure and viscous drag forces with less than 10% mean absolute error when compared to LES while offering a speedup of O(106).\n",
