      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we derive a pore-scale model for permeable biofilm formation in a two-dimensional pore. The pore is divided into two phases: water and biofilm. The biofilm is assumed to consist of four components: water, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), active bacteria, and dead bacteria. The flow of water is modeled by the Stokes equation, whereas a diffusion–convection equation is involved for the transport of nutrients. At the biofilm–water interface, nutrient transport and shear forces due to the water flux are considered. In the biofilm, the Brinkman equation for the water flow, transport of nutrients due to diffusion and convection, displacement of the biofilm components due to reproduction/death of bacteria, and production of EPS are considered. A segregated finite element algorithm is used to solve the mathematical equations. Numerical simulations are performed based on experimentally determined parameters. The stress coefficient is fitted to the experimental data. To identify the critical model parameters, a sensitivity analysis is performed. The Sobol sensitivity indices of the input parameters are computed based on uniform perturbation by ± 10% of the nominal parameter values. The sensitivity analysis confirms that the variability or uncertainty in none of the parameters should be neglected.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMixing-driven reactions in porous media are ubiquitous and span natural and engineered environments, yet predicting where and how quickly reactions occur is immensely challenging due to the complex and nonuniform nature of porous media flows. In particular, in many instances, there is an enormous range of spatial and temporal scales over which reactants can mix. This paper aims to review factors that affect mixing-limited reactions in porous media, and approaches used to predict such processes across scales. We focus primarily on the challenges of mixing-driven reactions in porous media at pore scales to provide a concise, but comprehensive picture. We balance our discussion between state-of-the-art experiments, theory and numerical methods, introducing the reader to factors that affect mixing, focusing on the bracketing cases of transverse and longitudinal mixing. We introduce the governing equations for mixing-limited reactions and then summarize several upscaling methods that aim to account for complex pore-scale flow fields. We conclude with perspectives on where the field is going, along with other insights gleaned from this review.\n",

      "abstract Abstract3D printing with powders offers the most analogous method to the natural way in which clastic reservoir rocks are formed, resulting in pore network textures and morphologies similar to natural rocks. To characterize pore networks and their transport properties in rock proxies 3D-printed from powdered materials, solid proxy reservoir rocks were 3D-printed in aluminum, steel, ceramic, and gypsum powders. These proxies were analyzed using traditional destructive and nondestructive reservoir characterization methods. While CT and helium porosimetry helped identify connected porosity, mercury porosimetry provided information on the pore-throat size distribution. X-ray fluorescence was used to identify elemental composition of each material. Thin-section petrography provided further information on proxy pore network microstructure. Despite designing a solid digital model, 3D printers using powder materials can impart significant porosity as a byproduct of the printing process that can be used for repeatable flow and geomechanical experiments in proxies. Ceramic and aluminum proxies showed the lowest porosity. Gypsum proxies had the highest porosity (36%) and range of porosities (5–36%). Metal proxies (aluminum and steel) showed low porosity and minimal mercury intrusion. Proxies were printed in two sizes (8 mm × 15 mm and 25 mm × 25 mm). Larger proxies were lower in porosity except in the case of gypsum because of post-processing artifacts. Ceramic and gypsum proxies showed significant compressibility at high mercury intrusion pressures. Proxies printed in silica sand were the most analogous to natural reservoir rocks despite their high porosity (36–51%) and pore-throat size mode (70 μm).\n",

The moisture and solute transport in the soil are described by the flow and advection–dispersion transport equations.\n",
      "These transport equations are solved by the spectral element method, which is based on Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rule and the fully implicit time scheme using the modified Picard iterative procedure constructed with the standard chord slope approximation. The estimation of hydraulic and solute transport parameters has been conducted using the Levenberg–Marquardt method. The goals of the inverse problem were to develop soil hydrochemical characteristics estimation strategies based on combined two of the following functional cost measurements: moisture content, pressure head, hydraulic conductivity, cumulative outflow, and solute concentration. The performance of the inverse algorithm was evaluated using the coefficient of determination, the root-mean-square error, and the relative error analysis which provide an optimal scheme for parameters estimation. The spectral element method was shown to provide good results with negligible error when compared to analytical values. The obtained results indicate excellent agreement of the method for estimating hydraulic and transport parameters with negligible relative error when compared estimated parameters and true values. The choice and the order of combination of objective functions affect crucially the inverse solution especially in case of large hydrochemical parameters estimates.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNano-remediation is a promising in situ remediation technology. It consists in injecting reactive nanoparticles (NPs) into the subsurface for the displacement or the degradation of contaminants. However, due to the poor mobility control of the reactive nanoparticle suspension, the application of nano-remediation has some major challenges, such as high mobility of the particles, which may favor override of the contamination, and particle aggregation, which can lead to a limited distance of influence. Previous experimental studies show the potential of combining nano-remediation with foam flooding to overcome these issues. However, in order to design and optimize the process, a model which couples nanoparticle and foam transport is necessary. In this paper, a mechanistic model to describe the transport of NPs with and by a foam is presented. The model considers the delivery of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and accounts for the processes of aggregation, attachment/detachment, and generation/destruction. Simulations show that when NPs are dispersed in the liquid phase, even in the presence of a foam, they may travel much slower than the NPs carried by the foam bubbles. This is because the nanoparticles in suspension are affected by the attachment onto the rock walls and straining at the pore throats. When the nanoparticle surface is, instead, modified in order to favor their adsorption onto the gas bubbles, NPs are carried by the foam without retardation, except for the small fraction suspended in the liquid phase. Moreover, very stable high-quality foam (\\(f_\\mathrm{g}\\)), i.e., 80–90 vol% of gas, can be attained using properly surface-modified nZVI (i.e., a nanoparticle-stabilized foam), allowing a significant reduction of water for the operation, while increasing the efficiency of nZVI delivery, even in a low-permeability medium within the shallow subsurface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTransport processes such as the dispersion and mixing of solutes are governed by the interplay of advection and diffusion, where advection acts to organise fluid streamlines and diffusion acts to randomise solute molecules. Thus, the structure and organisation of streamlines, termed the Lagrangian kinematics of the flow, is central to the understanding and modelling of these transport processes. A key question is whether the streamlines in three-dimensional (3D) Darcy flows can wander freely through the fluid domain, or whether all streamlines of the flow are organised into a series of smooth, non-intersecting two-dimensional (2D) surfaces. The existence of such a foliation of surfaces constrains the Lagrangian kinematics in a manner similar to that of 2D flows, which in turn constrains the allowable transport processes. In a series of pioneering studies, Sposito (Water Resour. Res., 30(8):2395–2401, 1994; Adv. Water Resour., 24(7):793–801, 2001) argues that steady Darcy flow in locally isotropic media gives rise to Lamb surfaces, 2D material surfaces which are spanned by both the streamlines and vortex lines (field lines of the vorticity vector) of the flow. Hence, the existence of these surfaces renders the kinematics of such 3D steady Darcy flow as two dimensions. This topological constraint strongly affects transverse mixing and dispersion because 2D steady flow fields limit the rate of deformation of fluid elements and can only admit zero hydrodynamic transverse dispersion. In this study, however, we show that Lamb surfaces are not ubiquitous to all steady Darcy flows in locally isotropic media. We derive the conditions for when Lamb surfaces exist in such Darcy flows, and discuss the implications of these findings for the transport, mixing, and dispersion of solutes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe TOUGH+Millstone simulator has been developed for the analysis of coupled flow, thermal and geomechanical processes associated with the formation and/or dissociation of \\(\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\) hydrates in geological media. It is composed of two constituent codes: (a) a significantly enhanced version of the TOUGH+HYDRATE simulator, v2.0, that accounts for all known flow, physical, thermodynamic and chemical processes associated with the behavior of hydrate-bearing systems undergoing changes and includes the most recent advances in the description of the system properties, coupled seamlessly with (b) Millstone v1.0, a new code that addresses the conceptual, computational and mathematical shortcomings of earlier codes used to describe the geomechanical response of these systems. The capabilities of the TOUGH+Millstone code are demonstrated in the simulation and analysis of the system flow, thermal and geomechanical behavior during gas production from a realistic complex offshore hydrate deposit. In the second part of this series, we describe the Millstone geomechanical simulator. The hydrate-dependent, rate-based poromechanical formulation is presented and solved using a finite element discretization. A novel multimesh coupling scheme is introduced, wherein interpolators are automatically built to transfer data between the finite difference discretization of TOUGH+ and the finite element discretization of Millstone. We provide verification examples against analytic solutions for poroelasticity and a simplified demonstration problem for mechanically induced phase change in a hydrate sediment.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSignificant progress has been made in the field of pore-scale imaging in the last decade which is revolutionizing various scientific disciplines, including biology, material science, and food engineering. Pore-scale imaging holds considerable potential for estimating volumetric and hydromechanical properties of rocks for a variety of geoscience applications. However, the micron-scale images, generated by the present imaging technology, are limited in resolution and thus a significant portion of rock pore volume can remain unresolved. We use the established concepts of capillary physics in rocks to infer rock porosity that sits in pores that are smaller than the image voxel without the need for higher resolution imaging that is only possible at the expense of image field of view or physical laboratory measurement. This allows us to estimate porosity of reservoir rocks using X-ray computer tomography even when a significant portion of pore volume is below image resolution. We find that the porosity inferred by our method matches the experimentally obtained total porosity for rocks. The proposed concept is also applicable to other modes of imaging, including thin-section light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and synchrotron source micro-CT.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe present a general novel technique to monitor saturation changes on small rock samples of only 15 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length for the purpose of assessing the kinetics of spontaneous imbibition processes. With a fully 3D imbibition configuration involving countercurrent flows through all faces of the sample, the method is based on an NMR technique in which the sole oil phase present within the sample is monitored. The experimental method is fast for two reasons that are (1) the possibility to perform accurate measurements on tiny samples and (2) the adoption of a 3D flow geometry. The kinetics of oil desaturation during spontaneous imbibition is analyzed with the help of an analytical 3D diffusion model, according to which the kinetics is proportional to the value of a “capillary” diffusion coefficient. For the purpose of demonstrating our methodology, we used this technique to compare the spontaneous imbibition of restored sandstone miniplugs from a sandstone reservoir, with and without alkali in the imbibing brine. The imbibition kinetics was quantified as capillary diffusion coefficient values. The studied case results revealed mixed impacts of alkali on the spontaneous imbibition kinetics, involving both a brine–oil interfacial tension change and a wettability alteration of the rock, the latter requiring further investigation beyond the scope of this article.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this paper, we critique the performance of the node control volume finite element (NCVFE) method for modeling multi-phase fluid flow in heterogeneous media. The NCVFE method solves for the pressure at the vertices of elements and a control volume mesh is constructed around them. Material properties are defined on elements, while transport is simulated on the control volumes. These two meshes are not aligned producing inaccurate results and artificial fluid smearing when modeling multi-phase fluid flow in heterogeneous media. We perform numerical tests to quantify and visualize the extent of this artificial fluid smearing in domains with different material properties. The domains are composed of tetrahedron finite elements. Large artificial fluid smearing is observed in coarse meshes; however, it decreases with the increase in mesh resolution. These findings prompt the use of high-resolution meshes for the method and the need for development of novel numerical methods to address this unphysical flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe stability of natural convection in a vertical layer of heat-generating Darcy porous medium saturated with an Oldroyd-B fluid using a local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model has been investigated numerically. The impermeable vertical walls of the porous layer are maintained at different uniform temperatures. As a consequence of LTNE model, two temperature equations representing the fluid and solid phases separately are used for the heat transport equation. A uniform volumetric heating in both fluid and solid phases is considered and the transfer of heat between the phases is considered in the basic state. The internal heating introduced asymmetry in the basic flow which led to the existence of competing modes. The intricacies of internal heat source strength in the fluid and the solid phases are clearly discerned on the stability of the system. The stress relaxation parameter \\(\\Lambda_{1}\\), fluid-heat generation parameter \\(Q_{f}\\), solid-heat generation parameter \\(Q_{s}\\) and the porosity-modified conductivities ratio \\(\\gamma\\) were found to exhibit destabilizing effect on the system, while the strain retardation parameter \\(\\Lambda_{2}\\) shows an opposite trend even in the presence of internal heating.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe extend previous analyses of the origins of complex transport dynamics in compressible porous media to the case where the input transient signal at a boundary is generated by a multimodal spectrum. By adding harmonic and anharmonic modal frequencies as perturbations to a fundamental mode, we examine how such multimodal signals affect the Lagrangian complexity of flow in compressible porous media. While the results apply to all poroelastic media (industrial, biological and geophysical), for concreteness we couch the discussion in terms of unpumped coastal groundwater systems having a discharge boundary forced by tides. Particular local regions of the conductivity field generate saddles that hold up and braid (mix) trajectories, resulting in unexpected behaviours of groundwater residence time distributions and topological mixing manifolds near the tidal boundary. While increasing spectral complexity can reduce the occurrence of periodic points, especially for anharmonic spectra with long characteristic periods, other signatures of Lagrangian complexity persist. The action of natural multimodal tidal signals on confined groundwater flow in heterogeneous aquifers can induce exotic flow topologies and mixing effects that are profoundly different to conventional concepts of groundwater discharge processes. Taken together, our results imply that increasing spectral complexity results in more complex Lagrangian structure in flows through compressible porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractExchange processes between a turbulent free flow and a porous media flow are sensitive to the flow dynamics in both flow regimes, as well as to the interface that separates them. Resolving these complex exchange processes across irregular interfaces is key in understanding many natural and engineered systems. With soil–water evaporation as the natural application of interest, the coupled behavior and exchange between flow regimes are investigated numerically, considering a turbulent free flow as well as interfacial forms and obstacles. Interfacial forms and obstacles will alter the flow conditions at the interface, creating flow structures that either enhance or reduce exchange rates based on their velocity conditions and their mixing with the main flow. To evaluate how these interfacial forms change the exchange rates, interfacial conditions are isolated and investigated numerically. First, different flow speeds are compared for a flat surface. Second, a porous obstacle of varied height is introduced at the interface, and the effects the flow structures that develop have on the interface are analyzed. The flow parameters of this obstacle are then varied and the interfacial exchange rates investigated. Next, to evaluate the interaction of flow structures between obstacles, a second obstacle is introduced, separated by a varied distance. Finally, the shape of these obstacles is modified to create different wave forms. Each of these interfacial forms and obstacles is shown to create different flow structures adjacent to the surface which alter the mass, momentum, and energy conditions at the interface. These changes will enhance the exchange rate in locations where higher velocity gradients and more mixing with the main flow develop, but will reduce the exchange rate in locations where low velocity gradients and limited mixing with the main flow occur.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTurbulence transportation across permeable interfaces is investigated using direct numerical simulation, and the connection between the turbulent surface flow and the pore flow is explored. The porous media domain is constructed with an in-line arranged circular cylinder array. The effects of Reynolds number and porosity are also investigated by comparing cases with two Reynolds numbers (\\(Re\\approx 3000,6000\\)) and two porosities (\\(\\varphi =0.5,0.8\\)). It was found that the change of porosity leads to the variation of flow motions near the interface region, which further affect turbulence transportation below the interface. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows that turbulent diffusion and pressure transportation work as energy sink and source alternatively, which suggests a possible route for turbulence transferring into porous region. Further analysis on the spectral TKE budget reveals the role of modes of different wavelengths. A major finding is that mean convection not only affects the distribution of TKE in spatial space, but also in scale space. The permeability of the wall also have an major impact on the occurrence ratio between blow and suction events as well as their corresponding flow structures, which can be related to the change of the Kármán constant of the mean velocity profile.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEstimating flow and transport properties of porous media that undergo deformation as a result of applying an external pressure or force is important to a wide variety of processes, ranging from injecting a fracking liquid into shale formations, to CO\\(_2\\) sequestration in spent oil reservoirs. We propose a novel model for estimating the effective flow and transport properties of such porous media. Assuming that the solid matrix of a porous medium undergoes elastic deformation, and given its initial porosity before deformation, as well as the Young’s modulus of its grains, the model uses an extension of the Hertz–Mindlin theory of contact between grains to compute the new PSD that results from applying an external pressure P to the medium, and utilizes the updated PSD in the effective-medium approximation (EMA) to estimate the effective flow and transport properties at pressure P. In the present part of this series, we use the theory to predict the effective permeability as a function of the applied pressure. Comparison between the predictions and experimental data for twenty-four types of sandstones indicates excellent agreement between the two.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Geometric straining of particles in porous media is of critical importance in a broad range of natural and industrial settings, such as contaminant transport in aquifers and the permeability decline due to pore plugging in oil reservoirs. Pore network modeling is a computationally efficient approach to simulate transport problems in porous media that has been used to simulate particle deposition and size exclusion. However, existing network models are unable to simulate particle jamming due to the simplification of geometry and the lack of capability for simulating particle–particle interactions. Here, we develop a novel pore network model for particle jamming in porous media. The jamming in pore throats is predicted by the probability of jamming, which is a function of pore/particle size ratio, particle concentration, and coefficient of friction (COF). A unified probability model is developed based on Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of particle jamming in porous media consisting of a single layer of spherical grains. The geometry is based on two packing extremes, those with grains arranged in a triangle and a square. The model is then implemented into the pore network model to predict jamming in porous media. This framework combines the efficiency of network modeling and the accuracy of direct simulations on particle jamming. We verify the model against CFD-DEM simulations. The results of network simulations show that the probability of jamming increases with COF. At low particle concentrations (C = 5%), the probability of jamming for large pore throats is small. There is a critical particle concentration (C = 9%) when the grain/particle size ratio is 10, above which jamming is self-reinforcing and the inlet face of the porous medium will be completely blocked (C = 11%). The effect of velocity on the probability of jamming is insignificant compared with the effects of particle concentration and pore/particle size ratio. Article Highlights We propose a novel pore network model for particle jamming based on the probability. The pore network model has a higher computational efficiency, compared with other numerical models, such as CFD-DEM model. The pore network model can accurately predict the permeability changes of porous media during the jamming process.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTemperature warmback analysis has been recently adopted to quantitatively infer the injection profile during injection of cold fluids in stratified and heterogeneous reservoirs. The rate of temperature recovery during a pause of the injection operation is sensitive to the injection profile. In this work, different analytical solutions are presented to model the transient temperature in the reservoir during the injection and the following shut-in periods considering variable injection rate and variable injection temperature conditions. The solutions are further extended to consider the thermal storage capacity of the wellbore as well as the thermal resistances of wellbore components that separate the temperature measurement tool from the sandface. Different inversion procedures are presented accordingly to infer the injection profile using the measured temperature history during the injection and the shut-in periods. Inversion procedures using optimization routines and/or graphical techniques are presented. The graphical techniques are valid for an extended shut-in time, while the regression analysis using optimization tools is applicable for any shut-in durations. Different synthetic cases are presented using a thermal compositional reservoir simulator to show the validity of the fully analytical and semi-analytical models developed in this work. The inversion approach is further applied to published field data for water injection operation in a stratified reservoir. The estimated injection profile is in close agreement with the reported results obtained using a numerical simulation tool.\n",

      "abstract AbstractRealizable CO2 storage potential for saline formations without closed lateral boundaries depends on the combined effects of physical and chemical trapping mechanisms to prevent long-term migration out of the defined storage area. One such mechanism is the topography of the caprock surface, which may retain CO2 in structural pockets along the migration path. Past theoretical and modeling studies suggest that even traps too small to be accurately described by seismic data may play a significant role. In this study, we use real but scarce seismic data from the Gassum Formation of the Norwegian Continental shelf to estimate the impact of topographical features of the top seal in limiting CO2 migration. We seek to estimate the amount of macro- and sub-scale trapping potential of the formation based on a few dozen interpreted 2D seismic lines and identified faults. We generate multiple high-resolution realizations of the top surface, constructed to be faithful to both large-scale topography and small-scale statistical properties. The structural trapping and plume retardation potential of these top surfaces is subsequently estimated using spill-point (static) analysis and dynamical flow simulation. By applying these techniques on a large ensemble of top surface realizations generated using a combination of stochastic realizations and systematic variation of key model parameters, we explore the range of possible impacts on plume advancement, physical trapping and migration direction. The stochastic analysis of trapping capacity and retardation efficiency in statistically generated, sub-seismic resolution features may also be applied for surfaces generated from 3D data.\n",

      "abstract AbstractOur study is keyed to the development of a viable framework for the stochastic characterization of coreflooding simulation models under two- and three-phase flow conditions taking place within a core sample in the presence of preferential flow of the kind that can be associated with the presence of a system of fractures. We do so considering various modeling strategies based on (spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous) single- and dual-continuum formulations of black-oil computational models and relying on a global sensitivity-driven stochastic parameter calibration. The latter is constrained through a set of data collected under a water alternating gas scenario implemented in laboratory-scale coreflooding experiments. We set up a collection of Monte Carlo (MC) numerical simulations while considering uncertainty encompassing (a) rock attributes (i.e., porosity and absolute permeability), as well as (b) fluid–fluid/ fluid–solid interactions, as reflected through characteristic parameters of relative permeability and capillary pressure formulations. Modern moment-based global sensitivity indices are evaluated on the basis of the MC model responses, with the aim of (i) quantifying sensitivity of the coreflooding simulation results to variations of the input uncertain model parameters and (ii) assessing the possibility of reducing the dimensionality of model parameter spaces. We then rest on a stochastic inverse modeling approach grounded on the acceptance–rejection sampling (ARS) algorithm to obtain probability distributions of the key model parameters (as identified through our global sensitivity analyses) conditional to the available experimental observations. The relative skill of the various candidate models to represent the system behavior is quantified upon relying on the deviance information criterion. Our findings reveal that amongst all tested models, a dual-continuum formulation provides the best performance considering the experimental observations available. Only a few of the parameters embedded in the dual-continuum formulation are identified as major elements significantly affecting the prediction (and associated uncertainty) of model outputs, petrophysical attributes and relative permeability model parameters having a stronger effect than parameters related to capillary pressure.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIt is well-known that the presence of geometry heterogeneity in porous media enhances solute mass mixing due to fluid velocity heterogeneity. However, laboratory measurements are still sparse on characterization of the role of high-permeability inclusions on solute transport, in particularly concerning fractured porous media. In this study, the transport of solutes is quantified after a pulse-like injection of soluble fluorescent dye into a 3D-printed fractured porous medium with distinct high-permeability (H-k) inclusions. The solute concentration and the pore-scale fluid velocity are determined using laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry techniques. The migration of solute is delineated with its breakthrough curve (BC), temporal and spatial moments, and mixing metrics (including the scalar dissipation rate, the volumetric dilution index, and the flux-related dilution index) in different regions of the medium. With the same H-k inclusions, compared to a H-k matrix, the low-permeability (L-k) matrix displays a higher peak in its BC, less solute mass retention, a higher peak solute velocity, a smaller peak dispersion coefficient, a lower mixing rate, and a smaller pore volume being occupied by the solute. The flux-related dilution index clearly captures the striated solute plume tails following the streamlines along dead-end fractures and along the interface between the H-k and L-k matrices. We propose a normalization of the scalar dissipation rate and the volumetric dilution index with respect to the maximum regional total solute mass, which offers a generalized examination of solute mixing for an open region with a varying total solute mass. Our study presents insights into the interplay between the geometric features of the fractured porous medium and the solute transport behaviors at the pore scale.\n",

The present study addresses the modeling of SRWC with particular attention paid to hysteresis effects of water filling and draining the pores attributed to ink-bottle effects. For that purpose, an idealized pore size distribution previously developed for predicting water sorption isotherms on cementitious materials, and which can consider the double porosity structure of soils, is used. The input data of the model are assessed only from mercury intrusion porosimetry tests (MIP) and from grain size distribution (GSD). The hysteretic behavior of SRWC is reproduced in a satisfactory way. The model can also predict the specific surface area.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe columns commonly used for the species separation of a binary fluid are very thin vertical parallelepipedic columns, filled with a porous medium (i.e. TGC columns). This species separation is due to the mass flux induces by the thermal gradient applied on walls of the cavity, namely the Soret effect, in the gravity field. In this paper, a new configuration used to study the species separation in a binary fluid was presented. The evolution of species separation in a binary fluid saturating a porous media, in a cavity between two concentric spheres, was studied analytically and numerically. The thickness of the cavity is \\(e=R_o-R_i\\), where \\(R_i\\) and \\(R_o\\) are the internal and external radii, respectively. First, an analytical solution was developed using the parallel flow approximation considering \\(e\\ll R_i\\). The analytical results obtained are in a good agreement with the numerical ones performed with a spectral method or Comsol Multiphysics software. Thus, the results in the spherical configuration were compared with those obtained in a porous TGC column of same thickness, e, height, \\(H=\\pi R_i,\\) and depth, \\(L=2R_o\\).The numerical and analytical studies showed that the differences in mass fractions, \\(C_{\\max }-C_{\\min }\\), and the time needed to obtain the stationary separation starting from a homogeneous binary solution were almost equal in the two configurations. The amount of species separated is greater in the spherical configuration than in the vertical column used.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe proposed study is an attempt to perceive theoretically the heat transfer phenomenon in the flow of temperature-dependent viscous blood through microvessels internally surrounded by a thin layer of endothelial glycocalyx at the wall. While flowing through microvessels, the blood separates into erythrocytes suspended fluid and cell-depleted fluid into core and peripheral regions respectively. Therefore, to best represent the flow of human blood in microvessels, it has been modeled as a two-fluid. Erythrocytes appearing in the core stimulates the non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid is manifested here by Herschel-Bulkley fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity. The plasma surrounded over the blood cells in the peripheral layer is expressed as a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity. An added advantage of utilizing the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation to govern the flow through the layer of endothelial glycocalyx (EGL) is that it is credible for both small and large Darcy numbers (permeability). Linear approximation of the Reynolds, viscosity model is exercised to obtain the analytical solutions for the governing equations of Herschel-Bulkley fluid flowing through the core region. In the non-porous peripheral region, the analytical solutions have been obtained for Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity directly and in the porous peripheral region, the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation is solved using regular perturbation for large Darcy number and singular perturbation with a matched asymptotic condition for small Darcy number. Analytical expressions for the velocity, flow rate, flow impedance, and temperature field have been obtained for the different regions. Graphical analysis revealing significant results regarding the variable viscosity, thermal conductivity, Grashof number, Forchheimer number, Richardson number, and permeability on the hemodynamical variables are conducted and results are discussed in detail. The study concludes that an EGL adjacent to the vessel wall increase the resistance to blood flow. The notable discovery of the study is that the temperature parameters influence all the quantities and therefore establish that the temperature-dependent viscosity plays a vital role in medical treatments involving temperature variation such as chemotherapy.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe stability of natural convection in an internally heated vertical porous layer confined between two impermeable boundaries which are kept at different constant temperatures is investigated. The momentum transfer is modeled by adopting Darcy’s law including time-dependent velocity term contribution. The conduction stream function and temperature fields are significantly altered due to internal heating, and the linear instability is analyzed through a study of normal mode perturbations on the base flow. The neutral stability curves and the critical Darcy–Rayleigh number for the onset of instability are evaluated by solving the stability eigenvalue problem numerically. It has been established that a uniform volumetric heat source and the Prandtl–Darcy number reinforce together in initiating the instability of the base flow under certain conditions despite their isolation presence evidences stability for all infinitesimal perturbations. Although the internal heat source strength is to hasten the onset of instability, and the Prandtl–Darcy number is found to induct both destabilizing and stabilizing impact on the base flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCarbon capture and storage is one of the key technologies that can help industries limit their environmental footprint and societies achieve the climate change mitigation goals. The process entails capturing CO\\(_2\\) and injecting it into deep geological formations for permanent storage. However, the design and modeling of carbon sequestration projects entail significant challenges in assessing the risks and long-term consequences. The fate of CO\\(_2\\) in the subsurface is dictated by many processes including solute transport, multiphase compositional effects, and trapping mechanisms. The ability to properly capture these phenomena is limited by the abstraction of numerical models, the uncertainty in petrophysical characterization, and the modeling of the thermodynamic effects. In this work, we study the impact of each of these factors on the fate of CO\\(_2\\) injection in a meter-scale experimental setup. We model the evolution of the CO\\(_2\\) plume inside the tank using the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We then present an ensemble-based approach to quantify the uncertainties and study the predictability of the numerical models. The results emphasize the ability of the reservoir simulator to predict the evolution of CO\\(_2\\) in the FluidFlower experimental setup. They also highlight the importance of considering the uncertainty in experimental testing of petrophysical properties in the risk assessment of geological carbon storage projects.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWettability is one of the critical parameters affecting multiphase flow in porous media. The wettability is determined by the affinity of fluids to the rock surface, which varies due to factors such as mineral heterogeneity, roughness, ageing, and pore-space geometry. It is well known that wettability varies spatially in natural rocks, and it is still generally considered a constant parameter in pore-scale simulation studies. The accuracy of pore-scale simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is undermined by such inadequate wettability models. The advent of in situ visualization techniques, e.g. X-ray imaging and microtomography, enables us to characterize the spatial distribution of wetting more accurately. There are several approaches for such characterization. Most include the construction of a meshed surface of the interface surfaces in a segmented X-ray image and are known to have significant errors arising from insufficient resolution and surface-smoothing algorithms. This work presents a novel approach for spatial determination of wetting properties using local lattice-Boltzmann simulations. The scheme is computationally efficient as the segmented X-ray image is divided into subdomains before conducting the lattice-Boltzmann simulations, enabling fast simulations. To test the proposed method, it was applied to two synthetic cases with known wettability and three datasets of imaged fluid distributions. The wettability map was obtained for all samples using local lattice-Boltzmann calculations on trapped ganglia and optimization on surface affinity parameters. The results were quantitatively compared with a previously developed geometrical contact angle determination method. The two synthetic cases were used to validate the results of the developed workflow, as well as to compare the wettability results with the geometrical analysis method. It is shown that the developed workflow accurately characterizes the wetting state in the synthetic porous media with an acceptable uncertainty and is better to capture extreme wetting conditions. For the three datasets of imaged fluid distributions, our results show that the obtained contact angle distributions are consistent with the geometrical method. However, the obtained contact angle distributions tend to have a narrower span and are considered more realistic compared to the geometrical method. Finally, our results show the potential of the proposed scheme to efficiently obtain wettability maps of porous media using X-ray images of multiphase fluid distributions. The developed workflow can help for more accurate characterization of the wettability map in the porous media using limited experimental data, and hence more accurate digital rock analysis of multiphase flow in porous media.\n",

Under the conditions of our experiments, we observe that precipitation reaction along the moving fluid–fluid interface generates solids in the form of mineral particle suspensions. We find that both electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces control the extent of particle–particle agglomeration during the suspension flow. Such particle suspension decreases the overall mobility of the multiphase mixture, thus altering the overall displacement. Although the injected fluids are viscously stable, the precipitation band that forms between the fluids becomes unstable to form finger-like flow channels compartmentalized by solid-deposited walls and clusters. We show that the emergence, growth and decay of the fingering pattern are strongly influenced by the injection rate and the initial fluid chemical concentrations. In addition, we show that precipitation-induced fingering has a strong feedback on fluid–fluid mixing and the subsequent precipitation rate. Lastly, we find that, counter to intuition, a higher injection rate results in a larger amount of precipitates that are securely deposited in the Hele–Shaw cell.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAdditive manufacturing (AM) allows the production of the internal structure of porous media (PM) with porosity and permeability tailored for a specific application. Material extrusion (MEX) AM enables the fabrication of a lattice-type porous structure by varying process parameters, usually applying the zigzag raster filling strategy. In a recent study, a Variable Bead Width Porous Filling (VBWPF) strategy was proposed, which generates pores by changing the printing speed during filament deposition and resulting in a unique porous structure with less pore interconnectivity. Specific pores’ dimensions and distribution on the layer can be obtained with the strategy’s parameters. In this work, different configurations of the VBWPF strategy were produced, and their porosity and permeability were measured experimentally. A PM with traditional raster filling (lattice structure) was also printed and measured for comparison. The porous structures of different VBWPF configurations were analyzed with micro-computed tomography (µCT). The results showed that VBWPF parameters were able to modify the porous structure obtained, changing the porosity and permeability of the PM. The PM produced exhibited 27% lower porosity and 55% lower permeability than the traditional raster filling PM with similar pore widths. These unique characteristics open up the field for applications of PM obtained through AM.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe impact of wettability on the co-moving velocity of two-fluid flow in porous media is analyzed herein. The co-moving velocity, developed by Roy et al. (Front Phys 8:4, 2022), is a novel representation of the flow behavior of two fluids through porous media. Our study aims to better understand the behavior of the co-moving velocity by analyzing simulation data under various wetting conditions. We analyzed 46 relative permeability curves based on the Lattice–Boltzmann color fluid model and two experimentally determined relative permeability curves. The analysis of the relative permeability data followed the methodology proposed by Roy et al. (Front Phys 8:4, 2022) to reconstruct a constitutive equation for the co-moving velocity. Surprisingly, the coefficients of the constitutive equation were found to be nearly the same for all wetting conditions. On the basis of these results, a simple approach was proposed to reconstruct the relative permeability of the oil phase using only the co-moving velocity relationship and the relative permeability of the water phase. This proposed method provides new information on the interdependence of the relative permeability curves, which has implications for the history matching of production data and the solution of the associated inverse problem. The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of wettability on fluid flow in porous media and provide a practical approach for estimating relative permeability based on the co-moving velocity relationship, which has never been shown before.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe fluid flow dynamics on the porous scaffolds and their static responses on the adjacent bone are very crucial parameters for bone adaptation. Researchers are trying to develop different algorithms to design biomimetic porous scaffolds incorporating bone tissue engineering. In this present work, three types of biomimetic heterogeneous porous scaffolds (HPS) were designed with the help of the Voronoi tessellation method and Swarm Intelligence and those were analysed under fluid perfusion as well as under static loading conditions. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, the wall shear stress (WSS) and the permeability of the porous scaffolds were compared to the natural trabecular bone to understand their hydrodynamic responses. In static analysis, the von Mises stresses of the Ti6Al4V scaffolds were checked to ensure no-yield condition. The strain energy density (SED) distributions were also studied on the neighbouring bone region of the femur greater trochanter to obtain stress shielding (SS) patterns and these findings were then compared with the natural trabecular bone at the same anatomical region. The outcome parameters, viz. the induced WSS, von Mises stress, the permeability, and SS of the scaffold, are found to be independent of the scaffold architecture. The von Mises stress and permeability increased with an increase in porosities, while the induced WSS and SS nature of the scaffolds showed the reverse trend. The results showed that the HPS designed based on the Swarm Intelligence incorporating Physarum Polycephalum algorithm offered the least SS level of 41.096 for 75% porous HPS, which may be considered the most promising result. Considering all the parameters, the novel designed scaffold based on Swarm Intelligence showed the most trabecular bone mimicking nature compared to the other scaffolds.\n",

      "abstract AbstractQuantifying the relationship between geometric descriptors of microstructure and effective properties like permeability is essential for understanding and improving the behavior of porous materials. In this paper, we employ a previously developed stochastic model to investigate microstructure–property relationships of nonwovens. First, we show the capability of the model to generate a wide variety of realistic nonwovens by varying the model parameters. By computing various geometric descriptors, we investigate the relationship between model parameters and microstructure morphology and, in this way, assess the range of structures which may be described by our model. In a second step, we perform virtual materials testing based on the simulation of a wide range of nonwovens. For these 3D structures, we compute geometric descriptors and perform numerical simulations to obtain values for permeability as an effective material property. We then examine and quantify the relationship between microstructure morphology and permeability by fitting parametric regression formulas to the obtained data set, including but not limited to formulas from the literature. We show that for structures which are captured by our model, predictive power may be improved by allowing for slightly more complex formulas.\n",

      "abstract AbstractColloidal transport and clogging in porous media is a phenomenon of critical importance in many branches of applied sciences and engineering. It involves multiple types of interactions that span from the sub-colloid scale (electrochemical interactions) up to the pore-scale (bridging), thus challenging the development of representative modelling. So far published simulation results of colloidal or particulate transport are based on either reduced set of forces or spatial dimensions. Here we present an approach enabling to overcome both computational and physical limitations posed by a problem of 3D colloidal transport in porous media. An adaptive octree mesh is introduced to a coupled CFD and DEM method while enabling tracking of individual colloids. Flow fields are calculated at a coarser scale throughout the domain, and at fine-scale around colloids. The approach accounts for all major interactions in such a system: elastic, electrostatic, and hydrodynamic forces acting between colloids, as well as colloids and the collector surface. The method is demonstrated for a single throat model made of four spherical segments, and the impact of clogging is reported in terms of the evolution of the critical path diameter for percolation and permeability. We identified four stages of clogging development depending on position and time of individual colloid entrapment, which in turn correlates to a cluster evolution and local transport.\n",

In particular, a generalised anomalous diffusion model departing from the classical Fickian diffusion and accounting for subdiffusion or superdiffusion phenomena is employed. At the porous layer boundaries, a uniform vertical concentration gradient is imposed, so that an unstable density stratification arises. The boundaries are modelled as open, meaning that uniform pressure conditions are prescribed. A linear stability analysis of the basic rest state is carried out, showing how the departure from the classical Fickian diffusion affects dramatically the conditions for the onset of the instability.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe linear stability analysis of Darcy–Brinkman–Bénard convection (DBBC) in a binary fluid-saturated porous layer is studied numerically using \\(n\\) term Galerkin approach for rigid–rigid, isothermal boundaries. The occupied binary fluid and porous medium are assumed to be in thermal non-equilibrium. Thus, two energy equations are used for each phase. The critical values of the Darcy–Rayleigh and wave numbers for the onset of convection are obtained by considering ten terms in the Galerkin solution. The effect of the five parameters of the model, namely the Darcy number, Da, the modified ratio of thermal conductivity \\(\\gamma\\), the Lewis number Le, the separation ratio coefficient, \\(\\chi\\), and the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, H, on the stability of the system is discussed in detail and presented with the aid of plots and tables. The onset of convection in a binary fluid-saturated porous medium is delayed for realistic boundary conditions compared with ideal boundary conditions (stress-free, isothermal boundary conditions). Increasing the values of the Darcy number, inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, and the separation ratio coefficient stabilizes DBBC. In contrast, the thermal conductivity ratio and Lewis number are destabilize the system. Furthermore, convective cell size remains unaltered with increasing \\(\\chi\\). Convection is delayed in the pure fluid medium compared to the binary fluid medium. Local thermal non-equilibrium ceases for small and large inter-phase heat transfer coefficient values.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany subsurface formations, such as soils, carbonate rocks, and mudstones, possess multiscale pore structures that impose significant challenges to the pore-scale modeling of flow and transport processes. Despite the development of several models, there is a lack of comparative studies and quantitative analysis to evaluate their performance. In this work, we present two image-based hybrid models for predicting absolute permeability and electrical formation factor: a dual-pore-network model (DPNM) and a pore-network-continuum model (PNCM). We use several publicly available digital rock samples of Estaillades carbonate, one of which includes experimentally characterized sub-resolution regions (i.e., microporosity) represented by 3D maps of porosity and entry pressure. We perform comprehensive comparisons between the DPNM and PNCM, focusing on the strengths and limitations of the DPNM. Our results show that, assuming homogeneous microporosity, both the DPNM and PNCM accurately predict absolute permeability and formation factors. However, for realistic heterogeneous microporosity, the DPNM significantly underestimates absolute permeability by more than an order of magnitude, compared to the PNCM. We also explore two methods to improve the performance of our DPNM. Our findings will provide a foundation for the application of DPNMs to a wide range of geological and engineering systems.\n",

This study presents a novel approach for multispecies contaminants transport in heterogeneous porous media that is founded on the temporally relaxed theory of Fick’s Law. The methodology introduces two relaxation times to account for solute particle collisions and attachment, leading to the derivation of new coupled ADEs. The semi-analytical solution is obtained in the Laplace domain after a linear transformation of Clement to address the mathematical complexity of the problem. The model’s simulation results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical models and existing analytical solutions for multispecies contaminants transport in Fickian and non-Fickian transport concepts. Results obtained demonstrated that the effects of time lagging of the temporal and spatial distribution of each species of the decay chain depend on the retardation factor, decay constant as well as input distribution of each member. Additionally, the temporal relaxed theory can quickly assess the risks incurred by drinking groundwater contaminated by radionuclides as shown in the application to \\({}^{238}{\\text{Pu}}\\) the decay chain in a waste deposition site. This innovative approach provides an in-depth understanding of the transport of contaminants from multiple species and its impact on groundwater contamination. The temporal relaxed theory seems promising for more accurately estimating the risks associated with decay chains, such as radionuclides.\n",

      "abstract AbstractGreen’s functions for two-point liquid sources analyze anisotropic mechanical-fluid interactions, providing insights for real-world applications and enabling precision in design optimization across geomechanics and biomechanics. In this paper, we uniquely derive the expression for a two-point fluid source influenced by poroelasticity in an infinite transversely isotropic material, providing a novel contribution to the literature. Initially, we obtain the general solution for the governing equations using the potential theory method with Almansi’s theorem. Subsequently, building on the general solution, we derive a fundamental solution for a two-point fluid source using harmonic functions with undetermined constants. These constants are determined through continuous and equilibrium conditions. The resulting exact solutions serve as benchmarks for numerical codes and approximate solutions, offering crucial support for a wide range of project problems. To provide further insight, we present complex numerical examples illustrating the physical mechanisms through contours. Results show symmetry around two-point fluid sources, with higher magnitudes and sign changes indicating compression and expansion zones. Zero contours and inflection points are identified, while coupling effects diminish in the far field and become singular at the sources, providing valuable insights into their spatial extent and intensity. To validate our results, we compare them with existing literature, enhancing the credibility of our approach and contributing to the ongoing dialog in the field.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe establishment of the representative elementary volume (REV) in studies of porous media is crucial for linking microscopic structure and pore-scale fluid configurations to macroscopic flow processes. We present analysis of the REV of porosity, specific interfacial area, and topological measures (Betti numbers and the Euler characteristic) for an air–water–Bentheimer sandstone system imaged using micro-CT at multiple wetting-phase saturation levels, acquired during primary imbibition (an unsteady-state displacement process). The original high-resolution tomographic data (1.66 μm voxel size) were downsampled to provide additional images at a range of voxel sizes, and REV analysis was also performed for these images. The results demonstrate that the REV is dependent on the image resolution: at large voxel size features are lost, resulting in unreliable parameter measurements. The wetting-phase saturation impacts the REV of the specific interfacial area, depending on the phase pair under consideration. Quantification of topological measures is especially sensitive to voxel size, as microporosity associated with clays in this sandstone sample significantly biases the results; treatment of microporosity is required to obtain connectivity results applicable to flow processes occurring within macropores. Additionally, the REV of the Euler characteristic is dependent on the heterogeneous structure of the air phase at intermediate saturations during the unsteady-state displacement processes. These results inform experimental design and 3D tomographic data acquisition parameter targets and provide insight into the microstructure of fluid phases during primary imbibition.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSolute transport in unsaturated conditions is important in various applications and natural environments, such as groundwater flow in the vadose zone. Studies of unsaturated solute transport show complex characteristics (e.g. non-Fickian transport) due to larger variations in the pore-scale velocities compared to transport in saturated conditions. However, the physical processes at the pore scale are still not completely understood because direct three-dimensional observations at the pore scale are very limited. In this study, single-phase and two-phase solute transport was directly characterized by performing tracer injection experiments in a sintered glass and Bentheimer sandstone sample. These experiments were imaged by continuous scanning with fast laboratory-based micro-computed tomography. The network-scale flow velocities and transport properties were characterized by using the pore-based transient concentration fields to determine the tracer’s arrival time and filling duration in every pore. Important measures for dispersion (the scalar dissipation rate and filling duration) were determined and indicated a wide range in pore-scale velocities and the existence of stagnant and flowing pores for the unsaturated experiments. Furthermore, we performed the first quantification of the mass transfer coefficient between stagnant and flowing pores on three-dimensional experimental data. We also calculated the tortuosity directly from the interstitial velocity and the pore-based velocity. This was found to be 13% higher in unsaturated conditions compared to saturated conditions. Our results indicate that pore-scale structural heterogeneity increases the differences between saturated and unsaturated solute transport. This study thus provides further insight into pore-scale spreading and mixing of dissolved substances in unsaturated porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractBiological tissue, pharmaceutical tablets, wood, porous rocks, catalytic reactors, concrete, and foams are examples of heterogeneous systems that may contain one or several fluid phases. Fluids in such systems carry chemical species that may participate in chemical reactions in the bulk of a fluid, as homogeneous reactions, or at the fluid/fluid or fluid/solid interfaces, as heterogeneous reactions. Magnetic resonance relaxation measures the return of 1H nuclear magnetization in chemical species of these fluids to an equilibrium state in a static magnetic field. Despite the perceived difference between reaction–diffusion and relaxation–diffusion in heterogeneous systems, similarities between the two are remarkable. This work draws a close parallel between magnetic resonance relaxation–diffusion and chemical reaction–diffusion for elementary unitary reaction \\({\\text{A}}\\to {\\text{B}}\\) in a dilute solution—both in heterogeneous systems. A striking similarity between the dimensionless numbers that characterize their relevant behavior is observed: the Damköhler number of the second kind \\({{\\text{Da}}}^{{\\text{II}}}\\) for reaction and the Brownstein–Tarr number \\({{\\text{BT}}}_{i}\\) for relaxation. The new vision of analogy between reaction- and magnetic resonance relaxation–diffusion in heterogeneous systems encourages the exploitation of similarities between reaction and relaxation processes to noninvasively investigate the dynamics of chemical species and reactions. One such example of importance in chemical engineering is provided for solid–fluid reaction in packed beds.\n",

This challenge is directly mirrored in image processing, where pore-scale grains and interfaces may be clearly visible in the image, yet continuous Darcy-scale parameters may be what are desirable to quantify. Classical image processing is poorly adapted to this setting, as most techniques do not explicitly utilize the fact that the image contains explicit physical processes. Here, we extend classical image processing concepts to what we define as “physical images” of porous materials and processes within them. This is realized through the development of a new open-source image analysis toolbox specifically adapted to time-series of images of porous materials.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEnzymatically induced calcium carbonate precipitation is a promising geotechnique with the potential, for example, to seal leakage pathways in the subsurface or to stabilize soils. Precipitation of calcium carbonate in a porous medium reduces the porosity and, consequently, the permeability. With pseudo-2D microfluidic experiments, including pressure monitoring and, for visualization, optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography, pore-space alterations were reliably related to corresponding hydraulic responses. The study comprises six experiments with two different pore structures, a simple, quasi-1D structure, and a 2D structure. Using a continuous injection strategy with either constant or step-wise reduced flow rates, we identified key mechanisms that significantly influence the relationship between porosity and permeability. In the quasi-1D structure, the location of precipitates is more relevant to the hydraulic response (pressure gradients) than the overall porosity change. In the quasi-2D structure, this is different, because flow can bypass locally clogged regions, thus leading to steadier porosity–permeability relationships. Moreover, in quasi-2D systems, during continuous injection, preferential flow paths can evolve and remain open. Classical porosity–permeability power-law relationships with constant exponents cannot adequately describe this phenomenon. We furthermore observed coexistence and transformation of different polymorphs of calcium carbonate, namely amorphous calcium carbonate, vaterite, and calcite and discuss their influence on the observed development of preferential flow paths. This has so far not been accounted for in the state-of-the-art approaches for porosity–permeability relationships during calcium carbonate precipitation in porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractDespite their diverse applications, experimental studies on multi-phase flow with phase change in fractured porous media are rare in the literature. In this study, water condensation of vapor in a fractured sandstone is investigated by means of 3D rapid in situ neutron tomography (30 s per tomogram). A water vapor and air mixture is injected at a constant rate, and the accumulation of condensed water is characterized through neutron tomography. Both phase-contrast and absorption-contrast X-ray tomography are jointly used to study the microstructure of the sandstone and measure the morphology of the splitting crack. The interplay between the pore matrix and fissure on the spatiotemporal distribution of water is studied through a combination of these techniques. The condensed water accumulates at the inlet boundary and gradually diffuses into the sample. Once the extracted crack is correctly aligned with with the neutron tomographies (registered), a propensity is seen for water to accumulate in small crack openings close to the cracks and migrate into the porous matrix predominantly due to the capillary effect. When enough liquid water condenses beyond a critical content, the air pressure in the crack transfers it into the porous matrix. This results in higher water content away from the crack. The water front propagates both along and transversely to the crack at a linear rate, albeit at different velocities. The final water distribution is found to be the result of two competing processes: condensation, occurring predominantly in the crack, and diffusion toward the matrix due to the capillary effect, as well as the pressure acting on the bottom of the sample and the crack walls.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe demonstrate how to use pore-scale modeling combined with high-resolution imaging to make predictions of multiphase flow properties. Experiments were performed on two sandstone samples that were mixed-wet after contact with crude oil: Bentheimer and a reservoir rock. Flow experiments were combined with high-resolution X-ray imaging from which the pore space, fluid configurations and local contact angles can be measured. We first show that both lattice Boltzmann modeling and a pore network model can predict the fluid occupancy to within experimental and model uncertainty in Bentheimer using the measured contact angles. We then used the greater computational efficiency of the network model to simulate flow in a large network representing the reservoir sample. By calibrating the contact angle to match the observed pore-by-pore arrangement of fluid, the model was able to make predictions of relative permeability and capillary pressure that were within the bounds of experimental and model uncertainty. The results provide a framework for predictive image-based pore-scale modeling, where wet and dry images of rock samples are used to characterize both the pore structure and wettability.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid flow in fractures has the potential to drastically change the economic, environmental, and safety risks associated with a subsurface operation. This work focuses on the analysis of experimental shear fracturing and subsequent shear displacement of a shale specimen that contains multiple pre-existing natural fractures. A triaxial direct shear apparatus with concurrent µCT imaging allowed continuous monitoring of sample permeability and changes in fracture geometry during fracture creation, displacement, and changes in stress. Steady-state, low Reynolds number fluid flow simulations were used to determine the changes of each individual fracture’s hydraulic aperture due to displacement and effective stress. The development of anisotropy in the hydraulic aperture of a generated shear fracture was determined for shear displacements of 0.38, 0.74, and 2.04 mm. At high confining stress (30 MPa), shear displacement significantly reduced the hydraulic aperture of the shear fracture to below flow detectable limits and X-ray imaging resolution (23 × 23 × 23 µm3). The shear generated fracture was found to be more sensitive to changes in effective stress compared to the pre-existing natural fractures. Existing models derived from fluid flow equations accounting for stochastic fracture roughness were able to partially fit the simulated flow properties of the pre-existing fractures, but no model was found to fit the flow properties of the newly formed shear fracture. These results are the first report of simultaneous changes in the geometry and flow properties of surrounding, parallel natural fractures as a shear fracture is generated with varying stress and shear displacement conditions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractSimulations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal from fluids contained in porous media (such as rock cores) need to account for both enhanced surface relaxation and the presence of internal magnetic field gradients due to magnetic susceptibility contrast between the rock matrix and the contained fluid phase. Such simulations are typically focussed on the extraction of the NMR T2 relaxation distribution which can be related to pore size and indirectly to system permeability. Discrepancies between such NMR signal simulations on digital rock cores and associated experimental measurements are however frequently reported; these are generally attributed to spatial variations in rock matric composition resulting in heterogeneously distributed NMR surface relaxivities (ρ) and internal magnetic field gradients. To this end, a range of synthetic sediments composed of variable mixtures of quartz and garnet sands were studied. These two constituents were selected for the following reasons: they have different densities allowing for ready phase differentiation in 3D μCT images of samples to use as simulation lattices and they have distinctly different ρ and magnetic susceptibility values which allow for a rigorous test of NMR simulations. Here these 3D simulations were used to calculate the distribution of internal magnetic field gradients in the range of samples, these data were then compared against corresponding NMR experimental measurements. Agreement was reasonably good with the largest discrepancy being the simulation predicting weak internal gradients (in the vicinity of the quartz sand for mixed samples) which were not detected experimentally. The suite of 3D μCT images and associated experimental NMR measurements are all publicly available for the development and validation of NMR simulation efforts.\n",

Characterizing the migration of colloids in porous media has been widely studied; however, few studies have quantified sub-core colloidal transport behavior and related this to bulk sample observations under transient conditions. In this study, the transport of colloidal kaolinite through sand packs is analyzed using UV–Vis spectrophotometry and positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging was completed by imaging an aqueous pulse of suspended radiolabeled kaolinite under single-phase flow conditions. The experimental PET imaging approach allows for the accurate 4-D quantification of changes in colloidal kaolinite transport, attachment, and detachment properties at the sub-centimeter scale. This study provides a novel approach for the quantification of inorganic colloid transport in geologic porous media, providing a foundation for future work to be done on more complex and heterogeneous systems under transient flow and fluid chemistry conditions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThermal properties play a critical role in environments and processes involving heat exchange and transfer. Heat transport in porous media has been a subject of extensive study due to its significant impact on applications ranging from in situ hydrocarbon production to geothermal energy projects. Micro-CT imaging has become a powerful tool for characterizing porous media, with its use increasingly expanding in recent years, driven by progress in computational techniques. Homogenization approaches provide a powerful means to analyze transport phenomena in Micro-CT images, offering reliable accuracy while reducing computational errors. In this study, the application of the hierarchical homogenization (HH) technique for thermal conductivity was explored. Various sources of error, including the choice of homogenization scale and numerical conditions such as padding thickness, were systematically investigated and compared to validation dataset acquired by Micro-CT data and high-fidelity direct numerical simulations. The results indicated less than 5% error in the first-order single-stage HH approach for all studied material schemas. Hyperbolic trend of the error was observed with the order of homogenization. Subsequently, telescopic hierarchical homogenization (THH) was found effective as a new approach for more complex systems with a negligible (less than 1.5%) error compared to single-stage HH. Furthermore, the HH error was investigated for a set of 19 synthetic and real samples to assess the effect of porosity and porosity variation in subsamples on the final error values, and a mathematical model was obtained for each of the material schemas. Results showed that in the similar porosity cases, sample with the higher dispersion of porosity will result in more error of thermal conductivity through HH procedure.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPore-scale finite-volume continuum models of electrokinetic processes are used to predict the Debye lengths, velocity, and potential profiles for two-dimensional arrays of circles, ellipses and squares with different orientations. The pore-scale continuum model solves the coupled Navier–Stokes, Poisson, and Nernst–Planck equations to characterize the electro-osmotic pressure and streaming potentials developed on the application of an external voltage and pressure difference, respectively. This model is used to predict the macroscale permeabilities of geomaterials via the widely used Carmen–Kozeny equation and through the electrokinetic coupling coefficients. The permeability results for a two-dimensional X-ray tomography-derived sand microstructure are within the same order of magnitude as the experimentally calculated values. The effect of the particle aspect ratio and orientation on the electrokinetic coupling coefficients and subsequently the electrical and hydraulic tortuosity of the porous media has been determined. These calculations suggest a highly tortuous geomaterial can be efficient for applications like decontamination and desalination.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTo characterize turbulence over porous media with porosities \\(\\varphi <0.5\\), three types of packed-beds were manufactured: cubically packed spheres (case S), randomly packed rice-grain-shaped pellets (case E), and crushed stones (case C), with measured porosities of \\(\\varphi =0.45\\), 0.37, and 0.30, respectively. After measuring their permeabilities, particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were conducted for flows under conditions characterized by the permeability Reynolds number (\\(Re_K\\)) ranging from 2.1 to 18.3. The results were then compared with previous data on turbulent flows over foamed ceramics with a porosity of \\(\\varphi \\simeq 0.8\\), reported by Suga et al. (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 31(6), 974–984, 2010). The measured turbulence characteristics were analyzed to examine their correlation with \\(Re_K\\) and to evaluate the applicability of a unified scaling approach across a wide range of porous beds. The findings suggest that while some distribution profiles generally follow \\(Re_K\\), this parameter alone is insufficient as a universal scaling factor for turbulence over packed-beds, as the roughness scale also exhibits significant dependence on surface shape rather than the porosity.\n",

      "abstract AbstractOften carrying a high-volume fraction of vesicles, basaltic rocks can be an important reservoir horizon in petroleum systems, and are considered an excellent candidate for CO2 storage by in situ mineral trapping. The frequency of amygdaloidal basalts in many sequences highlights the prevalence of mineralisation, but when the vesicle network has been filled, the basalts can act as impermeable seals and traps. Characterising the spatial and temporal evolution of the porosity and permeability is critical to understanding the petro-physical properties and CO2 storage potential of basalts. We exploit X-ray computed tomography (XCT) to investigate the precipitation history of an amygdaloidal basalt containing a pore-connecting micro fracture network now partially filled by calcite as an analogue for CO2 mineral trapping in a vesicular basalt. The fracture network likely represents a preferential pathway for CO2-rich fluids during mineralisation. We investigate and quantify the evolution of basalt porosity and permeability during pore-filling calcite precipitation by applying novel numerical erosion techniques to “back-strip” the calcite from the amygdales and fracture networks. We provide a semi-quantitative technique for defining reservoir potential and quality through time and understanding sub-surface flow and storage. We found that permeability evolution is dependent on the precipitation mechanism and rates, as well as on the presence of micro fracture networks, and that once the precipitation is sufficient to close off all pores, permeability reaches values that are controlled by the micro fracture network. These results prompt further studies to determine CO2 mineral trapping mechanisms in amygdaloidal basalts as analogues for CO2 injections in basalt formations.\n",

Here, we present an experimental methodology based on shadowgraphy to investigate the dynamic spreading of convective plumes in saturated transparent porous media made of glass beads. The saturated porous medium can be tuned transparent by matching the refractive index of the solid glass beads to that of the saturating fluid mixture. The proposed technique allows to investigate the essential elements of convective mixing within a porous medium using miscible fluids. We also describe a method to determine the velocity of convective plumes as they propagate. Our experimental results show that the density difference achieved during convection significantly affects the convective front velocity of the plumes. This is significant because it allows to quantitatively predict the intensity of convective mixing in porous media from the speed of the convective front.\n",

      "abstract AbstractInternal insulation of the building envelope is a prime topic in building physics, due to the risk of moisture problems that this technique entails. As a remedy to these problems, the application of a water-repellent agent, which reduces the amount of absorbed wind-driven rain, has become popular in recent years. When such an agent is applied on a building material, it penetrates the pore network of the material, hereby attaching itself to the pore surfaces and rendering them hydrophobic. It is generally believed that some smaller pores can remain hydrophilic due to the inability of the agent to enter. An in-depth microscopic investigation towards these hydrophilic pores, however, has never been performed. Since direct visualisation of the polymer chains was proven impossible, this paper locates the hydrophilic (parts of) pores in a material, hydrophobised with 3 different water-repellent agents, by imaging the moisture storage at pore level using X-ray computed tomography images at different stages of the desaturation process. While completely hydrophilic pore bodies and throats are not found in the studied material, water storage remains possible in hydrophilic corners of hydrophobised pore bodies and throats. These corner islands are less present than in hydrophilic media and do not form a continuous liquid flow path. Therefore, they provide possible locations for little moisture storage but do not contribute notably to moisture flow.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThis paper presents a method for particle tracing in laboratory X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT) using an adjusted Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm combined with least squares ellipse fitting (LSF). For method testing, a setup for the investigation of deep bed filtration (DBF) has been used as an example of a complex process that can be elucidated with such a method. Particle tracking with tomography systems requires high-temporal resolution which can only be achieved with synchrotron radiation computer tomography. Therefore, in this work, it has been demonstrated that instead of particle tracking, particle tracing in opaque systems such as DBF can be performed in laboratory µCT systems. To achieve particle tracing, dynamic µCT scans with a duration between 30 and 110 s combined with an exposure time of 0.13 s/projection were executed and during the scan time the filtration was performed, causing parabola shaped motion artefacts. The developed method exploits the motion artefacts created by the particle motion during the scan. It could be shown that it is possible to trace particles in complex structures within only one 30 s scan. Furthermore, through trace length and time, it is possible to determine the average velocity. Whereby, the accuracy and limits depend on the particle size, particle velocity/data rate and the X-ray attenuation of particle and medium.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn a pore network model, microscopic moisture storage and transport processes are modeled at pore level after which this information is extrapolated to obtain macroscopic properties describing the material’s moisture behavior. Such a model is typically validated by comparing measured and simulated macroscopic properties. However, due to the uncertainty associated with the experimental property determination, a possibly incorrect description of the model’s microscopic processes can be overlooked. Assessing the model’s ability to correctly simulate the moisture behavior at pore level is therefore required for its complete validation. To this aim, the moisture stored in the individual pores of unsaturated materials is imaged with the help of X-ray computed tomography images and compared to the moisture distribution simulated with a pore network model. The acquired X-ray computed tomography images clearly show the evolution of the drying process, wherein emptied pores retain water in their irregularly shaped corners. While some corners do not store any moisture, others allow a maximum of 10 % of the pore’s volume to be filled with corner islands. By comparing these images with the pore network model, however, it becomes clear that the amount of water, trapped in these pore corners is heavily overestimated in the model’s current implementation. Since this implementation is commonly used in existing pore network models, this paper proves the need of a detailed investigation of the corner islands in real porous media to formulate a different way of calculating moisture storage in pore corners.\n",

      "abstract AbstractImage-based simulations at pore scale provide direct insight into the impact of the microstructure on flow and transport processes in porous media. Diffusion is an important mechanism of mass transfer in gas or liquid phases, confined in porous media. Similar to fluid flow, the diffusive transport in porous media is a strong function of pore size and structure. Although the effect of porosity, pore connectivity and constrictivity of homogeneous porous media on macroscopic properties is clear, this is not well understood for heterogeneous porous media. This study uses a dual-structural-scale medium to analyze the effect of topological and morphological parameters on effective properties such as permeability and the effective diffusivity. A synthetic porous medium was created by two sizes of small and large glass beads, and 3D pore structure image of the sample was captured by X-ray computed tomography technique. The Stokes and diffusion equations were directly solved on the extracted pore geometry of sample, using a finite element method. The results show a strong nonlinear relationship between constrictivity, as a morphological parameter, with permeability and effective diffusivity. Based on the results obtained from pore-scale imaging and modeling, the connectivity of the pore space is increased by decreasing the Euler number and consequently the permeability and effective diffusivity is increased. Good agreement between image-based computed effective diffusivity with that estimated by van Brakel and Heertjes empirical relation confirms the reliability of this relation for heterogeneous porous medium, which includes constrictivity in addition to porosity and tortuosity, as three important morphological properties.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe conventional and a generalized form of Darcy’s law for the absolute permeability of porous media at low flow rates has been derived using the Langevin equation. It can account for the conventional viscous resistance and additionally a term referred to as thermal resistance. The latter is hypothesized to stem from the relationship between the mean and molecular random velocity along the mean flow direction. The key to note when using the Langevin equation as the starting point for the derivation is that the frictional resistance occurring are the same whether the fluid or the object is moving relative to each other. Hence, a spherical particle moving through a stagnant fluid will experience the same friction as a fluid flowing past a stagnant spherical particle. Experimental data for absolute permeability at different temperatures indicate a temperature dependency, which can be accounted for by the thermal resistance term, which so far has been neglected. A procedure for matching and predicting pressure variation and absolute permeability vs. temperature is described. The generalized form of Darcy’s law presented should be of interest in all sciences where fluid transport in porous media occurs at varying temperatures, e.g., in soil science, hydrology, geothermal, chemical and petroleum engineering. It has also been discussed in relation to the Kozeny–Carman equation.\n",

      "abstract AbstractX-ray computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used to characterize the morphology of water distribution in gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) applications. The resulting images can provide access to critical performance data for GDLs, including internal water contact angle distributions, water saturation, water cluster size, and pore-size distributions. Given the propensity for unimodal grayscale pixel distributions in X-ray CT images, basic image processing techniques like thresholding, erosion, and dilation are often insufficient. To address this issue, we used machine learning algorithms to segment X-ray CT image stacks of GDLs, comparing the performance of basic image processing with decision tree learning (via Trainable WEKA Segmentation) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (via U-Net and MSDNet). The training methods and classification features for each algorithm were varied and evaluated against a GDL sample with a semi-bimodal pixel distribution (SGL 10BA) and a more difficult, unimodal sample (EP40T). The optimal combinations for each algorithm were then applied to segment a GDL sample with a microporous layer (MPL), an SGL 10BC, as MPL-containing GDLs are generally preferred in PEFCs. We found that decision tree learning, aside from being the easiest to use, exhibited the best performance for each of the four phases—pores, water, GDL, and MPL—based on F1 scores. Based on the wide collection of literature, properly trained CNNs should produce significantly better results. However, obtaining such results may require substantially more investment to determine the optimal algorithm for a particular scenario.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTrapped foam saturation (\\(S_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\text{t}}}\\)), apparent viscosity (\\(\\mu { }_{{{\\text{app}}}}^{{\\text{f}}}\\)), and the limiting capillary pressure of foam (\\(P_{{\\text{c}}}^{*}\\)) are the common indices used to describe foam strength in porous media. They are linearly intercorrelated when they are obtained from a single porous medium. However, \\(P_{{\\text{c}}}^{*}\\) is inversely correlated with \\(S_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\text{t}}}\\) and \\(\\mu { }_{{{\\text{app}}}}^{{\\text{f}}}\\), when obtained from porous media with different pore structures. This paper investigates these contradictions and presents a new insight. Here, the three indices were obtained from 12 different rock samples with multiple steady-state foam injection coreflood experiments. The pore properties of the rock samples were measured with high-resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomography 3D imaging, pore network analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. Pore aspect ratio was found to offer opposing effects on \\(P_{{\\text{c}}}^{*}\\) relative to \\(S_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\text{t}}}\\) and \\(\\mu_{{{\\text{app}}}}^{{\\text{f}}}\\), resulting in an inverse relationship between them. Hence, \\(S_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\text{t}}}\\) or \\({\\mu }_{{{\\text{app}}}}^{{\\text{f}}}\\) may not be an absolute index of foam strength. Rather, mobile-trapped foam ratio (ranging from 0 to 1) appears to be a more appropriate index as it correlates linearly with \\(P_{{\\text{c}}}^{*}\\). A mobile-trapped foam ratio near zero indicates a very weak foam while a ratio of unity indicates a very strong foam. The ratio also correlates strongly with NMR relaxation time, making NMR log a promising tool for predicting foam strength in reservoir rocks. The graphical interpretation technique used to obtain these ratios is presented. This technique also allowed foam stability to be evaluated based on the ability of the trapped lamellae to withstand shear force during prolonged liquid flow. Based on these, different combinations of strength and stability of foam in porous media were identified namely strong and stable; strong and unstable; weak and stable, and weak and unstable foam.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThree-phase flow in porous media is encountered in many applications including subsurface carbon dioxide storage, enhanced oil recovery, groundwater remediation and the design of microfluidic devices. However, the pore-scale physics that controls three-phase flow under capillary dominated conditions is still not fully understood. Recent advances in three-dimensional pore-scale imaging have provided new insights into three-phase flow. Based on these findings, this paper describes the key pore-scale processes that control flow and trapping in a three-phase system, namely wettability order, spreading and wetting layers, and double/multiple displacement events. We show that in a porous medium containing water, oil and gas, the behaviour is controlled by wettability, which can either be water-wet, weakly oil-wet or strongly oil-wet, and by gas–oil miscibility. We provide evidence that, for the same wettability state, the three-phase pore-scale events are different under near-miscible conditions—where the gas–oil interfacial tension is ≤ 1 mN/m—compared to immiscible conditions. In a water-wet system, at immiscible conditions, water is the most-wetting phase residing in the corners of the pore space, gas is the most non-wetting phase occupying the centres, while oil is the intermediate-wet phase spreading in layers sandwiched between water and gas. This fluid configuration allows for double capillary trapping, which can result in more gas trapping than for two-phase flow. At near-miscible conditions, oil and gas appear to become neutrally wetting to each other, preventing oil from spreading in layers; instead, gas and oil compete to occupy the centre of the larger pores, while water remains connected in wetting layers in the corners. This allows for the rapid production of oil since it is no longer confined to movement in thin layers. In a weakly oil-wet system, at immiscible conditions, the wettability order is oil–water–gas, from most to least wetting, promoting capillary trapping of gas in the pore centres by oil and water during water-alternating-gas injection. This wettability order is altered under near-miscible conditions as gas becomes the intermediate-wet phase, spreading in layers between water in the centres and oil in the corners. This fluid configuration allows for a high oil recovery factor while restricting gas flow in the reservoir. Moreover, we show evidence of the predicted, but hitherto not reported, wettability order in strongly oil-wet systems at immiscible conditions, oil–gas–water, from most to least wetting. At these conditions, gas progresses through the pore space in disconnected clusters by double and multiple displacements; therefore, the injection of large amounts of water to disconnect the gas phase is unnecessary. We place the analysis in a practical context by discussing implications for carbon dioxide storage combined with enhanced oil recovery before suggesting topics for future work.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe typical characteristic of a thin porous layer is that its thickness is much smaller than its in-plane dimensions. This often leads to physical behaviors that are different from three-dimensional porous media. The classical Richards equation is insufficient to simulate many flow conditions in thin porous media. Here, we have provided an alternative approach by accounting for the dynamic capillarity effect. In this study, we have presented a set of one-dimensional in-plane imbibition and subsequent drainage experiments in a thin fibrous layer. The X-ray transmission method was used to measure saturation distributions along the fibrous sample. We simulated the experimental results using Richards equation either with classical capillary equation or with a so-called dynamic capillarity term. We have found that the standard Richards equation was not able to simulate the experimental results, and the dynamic capillarity effect should be taken into account in order to model the spontaneous imbibition. The experimental data presented here may also be used by other researchers to validate their models.\n",

      "abstract AbstractAdditive manufacturing (AM) allows the production of the internal structure of porous media (PM) with porosity and permeability tailored for a specific application. Material extrusion (MEX) AM enables the fabrication of a lattice-type porous structure by varying process parameters, usually applying the zigzag raster filling strategy. In a recent study, a Variable Bead Width Porous Filling (VBWPF) strategy was proposed, which generates pores by changing the printing speed during filament deposition and resulting in a unique porous structure with less pore interconnectivity. Specific pores’ dimensions and distribution on the layer can be obtained with the strategy’s parameters. In this work, different configurations of the VBWPF strategy were produced, and their porosity and permeability were measured experimentally. A PM with traditional raster filling (lattice structure) was also printed and measured for comparison. The porous structures of different VBWPF configurations were analyzed with micro-computed tomography (µCT). The results showed that VBWPF parameters were able to modify the porous structure obtained, changing the porosity and permeability of the PM. The PM produced exhibited 27% lower porosity and 55% lower permeability than the traditional raster filling PM with similar pore widths. These unique characteristics open up the field for applications of PM obtained through AM.\n",

A pressure infiltration equipment was made to infiltrate the preforms. The preforms were infiltrated at constant temperature (800 °C) and pressure (400 kPa) with different pressure-applied times (3, 5, 8, 11 and 15 s). Since the discrepancy between the infiltration heights measured in the experiment and calculated with the general infiltration equation was found, a modified infiltration equation was proposed considering the pore characteristic parameters from 3D μ-CT.

      "abstract AbstractMany properties of complex porous media such as reservoir rocks are strongly affected by heterogeneity at different scales. Complex depositional and diagenetic processes have a strong control on the pore structures, leading to systems with a wide range of pore sizes covering many orders of magnitude in length scales. This poses a significant challenge for digital rock analysis since a single resolution image and associated simulation model cannot capture all the relevant length scales in sufficient detail due to limitations in computer memory and speed. The scale-transgressive effects of heterogeneity must therefore be accounted for through a multiscale digital rock workflow. We introduce a generalized multiscale imaging and pore-scale modelling workflow to derive transport properties of complex rocks having broad pore size distributions. A dry/wet micro-CT imaging sequence is used to spatially map the porosity and the connectivity of resolved and unresolved porous regions. The unresolved porosity regions are classified into different porosity classes or rock types. The resulting 3D rock-type map and the porosity map are combined and transformed into a multiscale pore network model. Resolved pores are treated in a conventional pore network manner while unresolved network elements are treated as a continuum Darcy-type porous medium. Similar to conventional continuum models, each Darcy pore is populated with single and multiphase flow properties. These properties are derived from high-resolution rock-type models constructed from backscatter SEM images and/or high-resolution micro-CT images of sub-samples. The multiscale digital rock workflow is applied to two heterogeneous rock samples: a mixed wet thinly laminated reservoir sandstone and an oil wet reservoir carbonate. Experimentally measured mercury–air primary drainage and oil–water imbibition capillary pressure curves (after ageing to restore wettability) are used to anchor the multiscale pore network model. Waterflood relative permeability is calculated in a blind test and compared with high-quality experimental data. A very encouraging agreement between computed and measured properties is found.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA laboratory study of principal immiscible gas flooding schemes is reported. Very well-controlled experiments on continuous gas injection, water-alternating-gas (WAG) and alkaline–surfactant–foam (ASF) flooding were conducted. The merits of WAG and ASF compared to continuous gas injection were examined. The impact of ultra-low oil–water (o/w) interfacial tension (IFT), an essential feature of the ASF scheme along with foaming, on oil mobilisation and displacement of residual oil to waterflood was also assessed. Incremental oil recoveries and related displacement mechanisms by ASF and WAG compared to continuous gas injection were investigated by conducting CT-scanned core-flood experiments using n-hexadecane and Bentheimer sandstone cores. Ultimate oil recoveries for WAG and ASF at under-optimum salinity (o/w IFT of 10−1 mN/m) were found to be similar [60 ± 5% of the oil initially in place (OIIP)]. However, ultimate oil recovery for ASF at (near-)optimum salinity (o/w IFT of 10−2 mN/m) reached 74 ± 8% of the OIIP. Results support the idea that WAG increases oil recovery over continuous gas injection by drastically increasing the trapped gas saturation at the end of the first few WAG cycles. ASF flooding was able to enhance oil recovery over WAG by effectively lowering o/w IFT (< 10−1 mN/m) for oil mobilisation. ASF at (near-)optimum salinity increased clean oil fraction in the production stream over under-optimum salinity ASF.\n",

      "abstract AbstractBecause of their extreme heterogeneity at multiple scales, carbonate rocks present a great challenge for studying and managing oil reservoirs. Depositional processes and diagenetic alterations of carbonates may have produced very complex pore structures and, consequently, variable fluid storage and flow properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs. To understand the impact of mineralogy on the pore system, we analyzed four carbonate rock samples (coquinas) from the Morro do Chaves Formation in Brazil. For this study, we used thin sections and XRD for their mineralogical characterization, together with routine core analysis, NMR, MICP and microCT for the petrophysical characterizations. The samples revealed very similar porosity values but considerably different permeabilities. Samples with a relatively high quartz content (terrigenous material) generally had lower permeabilities, mostly caused by more mineral fragmentation. Samples with little or no quartz in turn exhibited high permeabilities due to less fragmentation and more diagenetic actions (e.g., dissolution of shells). Results confirm that carbonate minerals are very susceptible to diagenesis, leading to modifications in their pore body and pore throat sizes, and creating pores classified as moldic and vug pores, or even clogging them. For one of the samples, we acquired detailed pore skeleton information based on microCT images to obtain a more complete understanding of its structural characteristics.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe compare two conceptually different stochastic microstructure models, i.e., a graph-based model and a pluri-Gaussian model, that have been introduced to model the transport properties of three-phase microstructures occurring, e.g., in solid oxide fuel cell electrodes. Besides comparing both models, we present new results regarding the relationship between model parameters and certain microstructure characteristics. In particular, an analytical expression is obtained for the expected length of triple phase boundary per unit volume in the pluri-Gaussian model. As a case study, we consider 3D image data which show a representative cutout of a solid oxide fuel cell anode obtained by FIB-SEM tomography. The two models are fitted to image data and compared in terms of morphological characteristics (like mean geodesic tortuosity and constrictivity) as well as in terms of effective transport properties. The Stokes flow in the pore phase and effective conductivities in the solid phases are computed numerically for realizations of the two models as well as for the 3D image data using Fourier methods. The local and effective physical responses of the model realizations are compared to those obtained from 3D image data. Finally, we assess the accuracy of the two methods to predict permeability as well as electronic and ionic conductivities of the anode.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Membrane distillation (MD) is a desalination technique that uses a membrane to thermally separate potable water from sea or brackish water. The mass transport processes through the membrane are commonly described by the dusty gas model. These processes are modeled assuming uniform, ideally cylindrical capillaries and are adjusted for the membrane geometry by including porosity and tortuosity. The tortuosity is usually set to 2 or is used as an adjusting parameter to fit theoretical models to experimentally measured data. In this work, ptychographic X-ray computed tomography is employed to map the three-dimensional (3D) structure of three commercial state-of-the-art PTFE membranes in MD. The porosity, tortuosity and permeability (viscous flow coefficient) of the samples are computed using the lattice Boltzmann method. The intrinsic permeability is compared to the dusty gas model and an apparent permeability is proposed which is corrected for Knudsen slip effects at the membrane structure. Article Highlights 3D structure of membranes for distillation measured at full height at an unprecedented detail using X-ray ptychography for the first time. Comparison of the dusty gas model to 3D direct numerical simulation: permeability and Knudsen effects.

      "abstract AbstractWe study the question of how visual analysis can support the comparison of spatio-temporal ensemble data of liquid and gas flow in porous media. To this end, we focus on a case study, in which nine different research groups concurrently simulated the process of injecting CO\\(_2\\) into the subsurface. We explore different data aggregation and interactive visualization approaches to compare and analyze these nine simulations. In terms of data aggregation, one key component is the choice of similarity metrics that define the relationship between different simulations. We test different metrics and find that using the machine-learning model “S4” (tailored to the present study) as metric provides the best visualization results. Based on that, we propose different visualization methods. For overviewing the data, we use dimensionality reduction methods that allow us to plot and compare the different simulations in a scatterplot. To show details about the spatio-temporal data of each individual simulation, we employ a space-time cube volume rendering. All views support linking and brushing interaction to allow users to select and highlight subsets of the data simultaneously across multiple views. We use the resulting interactive, multi-view visual analysis tool to explore the nine simulations and also to compare them to data from experimental setups. Our main findings include new insights into ranking of simulation results with respect to experimental data, and the development of gravity fingers in simulations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractNumerical simulation can provide detailed understanding of mass transport within complex structures. For this purpose, numerical tools are required that can resolve the complex morphology and consider the contribution of both convection and diffusion. Solving the Navier–Stokes equations alone, however, neglects self-diffusion. This influences the simulated displacement distribution of flow especially in porous media at low Péclet numbers (Pe < 16) and in near-wall regions where diffusion is the dominant mechanism. To address this problem, this study uses μCT-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in OpenFOAM coupled with the random-walk particle tracking (PT) module disTrackFoam and cross-validated experimentally using pulsed-field gradient (PFG) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of gas flow within open-cell foams (OCFs). The results of the multi-scale simulations—with a resolution of 130–190 µm—and experimental PFG NMR data are compared in terms of diffusion propagators, which are microscopic displacement distributions of gas flows in OCFs during certain observation times. Four different flow rates with Péclet numbers in the range of 0.7–16 are studied in the laminar flow regime within 10 and 20 PPI OCFs, and axial dispersion coefficients were calculated. Cross-validation of PFG NMR measurements and CFD-PT simulations revealed a very good matching with integral differences below 0.04%, underpinning the capability of both complementary methods for multi-scale transport analysis.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA numerical model is investigated representing counter-current spontaneous imbibition of water to displace oil or gas from a core plug. The model is based on mass and momentum conservation equations in the framework of the theory of mixtures. We extend a previous imbibition model that included fluid–rock friction and fluid–fluid drag interaction (viscous coupling) by including fluid compressibility and Brinkman viscous terms. Gas compressibility accelerated recovery due to gas expansion from high initial non-wetting pressure to ambient pressure at typical lab conditions. Gas compressibility gave a recovery profile with two characteristic linear sections against square root of time which could match tight rock literature experiments. Brinkman terms decelerated recovery and delayed onset of imbibition. Experiments where this was prominent were successfully matched. Both compressibility and Brinkman terms caused recovery deviation from classical linearity with the square root of time. Scaling yielded dimensionless numbers when Brinkman term effects were significant.Article Highlights\n",

      "abstract AbstractUnderstanding hyporheic processes is key to support stream health and functioning. The present study addresses the impact of weak buoyancy effects on hyporheic exchange. In this context, we focus on the density-driven processes on pore scale, which had not been investigated so far to our knowledge. For that purpose, the transport of an active scalar across the interface between a turbulent free-flow region and a random sphere pack with macroscopically flat surface was investigated by pore-resolved single-domain direct numerical simulation. At a permeability Reynolds number of \\(Re_K = 1.63\\) and a friction Reynolds number of \\(Re_\\tau = 173\\), seven simulation cases were evaluated with Rayleigh–Darcy numbers varying within the range of \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} \\in [-20, 400]\\), where \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} < 0\\) represents stabilising and \\(Ra_\\textrm{D} > 0\\) destabilising buoyancy effects. While turbulent scalar transport dominates the well-mixed free-flow region, dispersive transport contributes considerably to the scalar flux within the sphere pack, even in the absence of buoyancy effects. The latter observation implies that the velocity and scalar field must be spatially heterogeneous. Under these conditions, even weak destabilising buoyancy effects can enhance spatial variations, strengthen preferred scalar advection paths, and increase the hyporheic flux. A stabilising stratification of the scalar field has the opposite effect and reduces the vertical exchange within the porous medium. We conclude that even though weak buoyancy effects do not introduce genuine density-driven instabilities, they have a clear quantitative impact on hyporheic exchange with far-reaching ecological implications.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA new model for the multi-scale simulation of solute transport in concrete is presented. The model employs plurigaussian simulations to generate stochastic representations of concrete micro- and meso-structures. These are idealised as two-phase medium comprising mortar matrix and pores for the micro-structure, and mortar and large aggregate particles for the meso-structure. The generated micro- and meso-structures are employed in a finite element analysis for the simulation of steady-state diffusion of solutes. The results of the simulations are used to calculate effective diffusion coefficients of the two-phase micro- and meso-structures, and in turn, the effective diffusion coefficient at the macro-scale at which the concrete material is considered homogenous. Multiple micro- and meso-structures are generated to account for uncertainty at the macro-scale. In addition, the level of uncertainty in the calculated effective diffusion coefficients is quantified through a statistical analysis. The numerical predictions are validated against experimental observations concerning the diffusion of chloride through a concrete specimen, suggesting that the generated structures are representative of the pore-space and coarse aggregate seen at the micro- and meso-scales, respectively. The method also has a clear advantage over many other structural generation methods, such as packing algorithms, due to its low computational expense. The stochastic generation method has the ability to represent many complex phenomena in particulate materials, the characteristics of which may be controlled through the careful choice of intrinsic field parameters and lithotype rules.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Plurigaussian simulation is a method of discrete random field generation that can be used to generate many complex geometries depicting real world structures. Whilst it is commonly applied at larger scales to represent geological phenomena, the highly flexible approach is suitable for generating structures at all scales. Here, an extension of plurigaussian simulation to periodic plurigaussian simulation (P-PGS) is presented, such that the resulting fields are periodic in nature. By using periodic Gaussian random fields as components of the method, periodicity is enforced in the generated structures. To substantiate the use of P-PGS in capturing complex heterogeneities in a physically meaningful way, the pore-scale microstructure of cement paste was represented such that its effective properties can be calculated through a computational homogenisation approach. The finite element method is employed to model the diffusion of heat through the medium under dry and saturated pore conditions, where numerical homogenisation is conducted to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the medium. Comparison of the calculated values with experimental observations indicated that the generated microstructures are suitable for pore-scale representation, given their close match. A maximal error of 1.38% was observed in relation to the numerically determined effective thermal conductivity of mortar paste with air filled pores, and 0.41% when considering water filled pores. As the assumption of a periodic domain is often an underlying feature of numerical homogenisation, this extension of plurigaussian simulation enables a path for its integration into such computational schemes. Article Highlights Integrating P-PGS into numerical homogenisation frameworks enhances complex heterogeneous material representation The flexibility of P-PGS enables a wide range of material microstructures to be represented accurately Use of the generated structures allows material properties to be estimated accurately through numerical homogenisation\n",

      "abstract AbstractOstwald ripening of gas bubbles is a thermodynamic process for mass transfer, which is important for both foam enhanced oil recovery and geological CO2 storage. We present a methodology for simulating Ostwald ripening of gas ganglia surrounded by liquid in arbitrary pore geometries. The method couples a conservative level set model for capillary-controlled displacement and a ghost-bubble technique that calculates mass transfer based on difference in chemical potentials. The methodology is implemented in a software framework for parallel computations. As a validation of the model, we show that simulations of bubble ripening in a pore throat connecting two pore bodies are consistent with previously reported trends in similar geometries. Then we investigate the impact of gas type, compressibility factor, and local capillary pressure on gas-bubble ripening in various water-wet pore geometries. The results confirm that gas solubility and compressibility factor are proportional to the rate of mass transfer. Our simulations suggest that Ostwald ripening has largest impact in heterogeneous or fractured porous structures where differences in gas-bubble potentials are high. However, if the liquid separating the gas bubbles is also a disconnected phase, which can happen in intermediate-wet porous media, the resulting local capillary pressure can limit the coarsening and stabilise smaller bubbles. Finally, we simulated Ostwald ripening on a 3-D pore-space image of sandstone containing a residual gas/water configuration after imbibition. Characterization of gas-bubble morphology during the coarsening shows that large ganglia get more ramified at the expense of small spherical ganglia that cease to exist.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFast, data-driven prediction of transport properties of porous media from 2D images is important for materials design and optimization. This work presents prediction of liquid transport in 3D materials using geometric characteristics of pore cross sections. A dataset of 1733 digital structures, of which about a half has impermeable non-percolated systems of isolated pores, was generated using coarse-grained simulations mimicking formation of porous glasses and porous polymer membranes. 2D pore cross sections were characterized by the surface area, perimeter, and asymmetry. Liquid permeability and self-diffusion coefficients of tracers of varying sizes were calculated using lattice Boltzmann and Monte Carlo simulations, correspondingly. On these simulation results, machine learning models were built for (a) distinguishing permeable (percolated) from impermeable (non-percolated) structures and (b) predicting transport properties from pore cross-section characteristics. Very reasonable accuracy was achieved, despite a wide permeability range of the dataset. Gradient boosting method was employed with two-step learning: First, classification model distinguished the permeable samples, and second, a regression model predicted the dynamic properties. The total pore volume and the non-circular shape of the pore cross sections made the strongest influence on the transport properties, but no single feature was dominant. The model trained on synthetic polymer structures was applied to several sandstone samples, with a reasonable predictive accuracy for permeabilities within the training range, and demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. In addition, a separate gradient boosting model was trained on a semi-real dataset based on augmented real images, achieving high determination score and confirming the potential of the method for broader range of materials.\n",

      "abstract AbstractGeologic carbon storage in deep saline aquifers has emerged as a promising technique to mitigate climate change. CO2 is buoyant at the storage conditions and tends to float over the resident brine jeopardizing long-term containment goals. Therefore, the caprock sealing capacity is of great importance and requires detailed assessment. We perform supercritical CO2 injection experiments on shaly caprock samples (intact caprock and fault zone) under representative subsurface conditions. We numerically simulate the experiments, satisfactorily reproducing the observed evolution trends. Simulation results highlight the dynamics of CO2 flow through the specimens with implications to CO2 leakage risk assessment in field practices. The large injection-induced overpressure drives CO2 in free phase into the caprock specimens. However, the relative permeability increase following the drainage path is insufficient to provoke an effective advancement of the free-phase CO2. As a result, the bulk CO2 front becomes almost immobile. This implies that the caprock sealing capacity is unlikely to be compromised by a rapid capillary breakthrough and the injected CO2 does not penetrate deep into the caprock. In the long term, the intrinsically slow molecular diffusion appears to dominate the migration of CO2 dissolved into brine. Nonetheless, the inherently tortuous nature of shaly caprock further holds back the diffusive flow, favoring safe underground storage of CO2 over geological time scales.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn this work, a Lattice Boltzmann model for multi-component fluids augmented with repulsive near-contact interactions is employed to simulate the dynamics of flowing emulsions within idealized pores. The model is firstly tested on experimental data of droplets’ self-assembly in diverging-converging micro-channels from literature and then used to investigate the trapping/mobilization of the dispersed phase of an emulsion in an idealized series of pores, as influenced by both the Capillary number and the solid walls wettability. Both parameters may vary as the result of an injection of surfactants, a procedure commonly adopted in soil remediation and Enhanced Oil Recovery applications. The analysis shows that the proposed model is able to reproduce correctly the experimental data and gives interesting insights on the trapping/mobilization phenomenon resulting from a modification of the flow conditions caused by the injection of surfactants.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany shallow ex-situ and in-situ remediation treatments come from the contamination of underground soils and groundwater sources by organic hydrocarbon components called non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). These contaminants, if leaking, can impose long-term threats causing environmental and health concerns. One of the versatile in-situ remediation techniques is using surfactant/foam processes that can overcome subsurface heterogeneity and improve NAPL removal. Motivated by an earlier study of successful implementation of surfactant/foam in-situ remediation processes, this simulation study investigates the next phase of the research, that is, (i) understanding two different roles of foams during the treatment: foams for “mobility control” vs. foams for “blocking” and (ii) evaluating the potential of blocking foams by placing foams downstream (i.e., foam injected into the downstream extraction wells, but surfactant is still injected into the upstream injection wells). When twenty-four different scenarios are taken into consideration for the 23-days pilot test with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells, the results from the simulations reveal that using foams for blocking purpose is as efficient as, or more efficient than, foams for mobility-control purpose, exhibiting the oil recovery up to near 94.9%. Additional simulation efforts also show that foams as a blocking agent have a unique advantage over mobility-control foams because of less pressure buildup required and, therefore, less chance of displacing the contaminants out of the treatment area. This feasibility study of examining foams as a blocking agent focuses on vertical wells currently, which can be regarded as a stepping stone into the broader range of similar applications with horizontal wells located in hilly terrain.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEnhanced water removal through the gas diffusion layer (GDL) is important for the design of high-performance proton exchange fuel cells. In this work, the effects of GDL thickness and open area fraction at the GDL/flow field interface are examined under water invasion  for a carbon-paper GDL (similar to Toray TGP-H series). Both uncompressed and inhomogeneously compressed samples are considered. Transport in heterogeneous, macroporous GDLs is modeled by means of a hybrid 3D discrete/continuum formulation based on a subdivision of the porous medium into control volumes due to the lack of a well-defined separation between pore and layer scales. Capillary-dominated transport of liquid water is simulated with an invasion percolation algorithm, while oxygen diffusion is simulated with a continuum formulation. Model predictions are validated with previous numerical and experimental data. It is shown that the combination of thin GDLs (\\(\\mathrm {thickness} \\sim 100\\; \\mu \\mathrm {m}\\)) and high GDL/flow field open area fractions can facilitate water removal/oxygen supply from/to the catalyst layer and can provide a more uniform oxygen distribution over large cell active areas. In agreement with previous work, porous flow fields with pore sizes comparable to the GDL thickness are good candidates to meet the above requirements, while improving water removal from the flow field (higher gas-phase velocity than conventional millimeter-sized channels) and ensuring a more uniform assembly compression.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid injection can induce mechanical deformation in granular porous media due to the elevation of internal pore fluid pressure. This gains more significance when more than two immiscible fluids are involved, attributable to capillary and viscous drag forces. Such a coupled hydromechanical behavior associated with immiscible fluid flows plays an important role in injection, storage, and recovery of fluids in deformable porous media. This study presents a dimensionless map with newly proposed dimensionless parameters to predict deformation occurrence due to an immiscible fluid flow in deformable porous media. A series of hydromechanically coupled pore network simulations are first performed while varying the capillary number, mobility ratio, medium stiffness, and effective confining stress over orders of magnitudes. The compilation of simulation results with previously published Hele–Shaw experiment results is analyzed with the dimensionless parameters, such as the capillary number, mobility ratio, particle-level force ratios, and particle-level pressure ratios. Particularly, the particle-level pressure ratios include the capillary pressure ratio, defined as the ratio of capillary pressure to fracture pressure, and the viscous drag pressure, defined as the ratio of viscous drag pressure to fracture pressure. The dimensionless map based on the particle-level pressure ratios, where the capillary pressure ratio and viscous drag pressure ratio are defined as the ratios of capillary pressure and viscous drag pressure to fracture pressure, effectively delineates four deformation regimes—no deformation, capillary-induced deformation, drag-driven deformation, and mixed-mode deformation. The results demonstrate that capillary-induced deformation occurs when the capillary pressure ratio is greater than 10−1, while drag-driven deformation is observed when the viscous drag pressure ratio exceeds 10−2. The presented dimensionless map and dimensionless parameters are expected to be applicable for geological subsurface processes, including geological storage of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and enhanced oil recovery.\n",

      "abstract AbstractOur study is keyed to the development of a viable framework for the stochastic characterization of coreflooding simulation models under two- and three-phase flow conditions taking place within a core sample in the presence of preferential flow of the kind that can be associated with the presence of a system of fractures. We do so considering various modeling strategies based on (spatially homogeneous or heterogeneous) single- and dual-continuum formulations of black-oil computational models and relying on a global sensitivity-driven stochastic parameter calibration. The latter is constrained through a set of data collected under a water alternating gas scenario implemented in laboratory-scale coreflooding experiments. We set up a collection of Monte Carlo (MC) numerical simulations while considering uncertainty encompassing (a) rock attributes (i.e., porosity and absolute permeability), as well as (b) fluid–fluid/ fluid–solid interactions, as reflected through characteristic parameters of relative permeability and capillary pressure formulations. Modern moment-based global sensitivity indices are evaluated on the basis of the MC model responses, with the aim of (i) quantifying sensitivity of the coreflooding simulation results to variations of the input uncertain model parameters and (ii) assessing the possibility of reducing the dimensionality of model parameter spaces. We then rest on a stochastic inverse modeling approach grounded on the acceptance–rejection sampling (ARS) algorithm to obtain probability distributions of the key model parameters (as identified through our global sensitivity analyses) conditional to the available experimental observations. The relative skill of the various candidate models to represent the system behavior is quantified upon relying on the deviance information criterion. Our findings reveal that amongst all tested models, a dual-continuum formulation provides the best performance considering the experimental observations available. Only a few of the parameters embedded in the dual-continuum formulation are identified as major elements significantly affecting the prediction (and associated uncertainty) of model outputs, petrophysical attributes and relative permeability model parameters having a stronger effect than parameters related to capillary pressure.\n",

      "abstract AbstractEvaporation of droplets formed at the interface of a coupled free-flow–porous medium system enormously affects the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between the two domains. In this work, we develop a model to describe multiple droplets’ evaporation at the interface, in which new sets of coupling conditions including the evaporating droplets are developed to describe the interactions between the free flow and the porous medium. Employing pore-network modeling to describe the porous medium, we take the exchanges occurring on the droplet–pore and droplet–free-flow interfaces into account. In this model, we describe the droplet evaporation as a diffusion-driven process, where vapor from the droplet surface diffuses into the surrounding free flow due to the concentration gradient. To validate the model, we compare the simulation results for the evaporation of a single droplet in a channel with experimental data, demonstrating that our model accurately describes the evaporation process. Then, we examine the impact of free-flow and porous medium properties on droplet evaporation. The results show that, among other factors, velocity and relative humidity in the free-flow domain, as well as pore temperature in the porous medium, play key roles in the droplet evaporation process.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCarbon capture and storage is one of the key technologies that can help industries limit their environmental footprint and societies achieve the climate change mitigation goals. The process entails capturing CO\\(_2\\) and injecting it into deep geological formations for permanent storage. However, the design and modeling of carbon sequestration projects entail significant challenges in assessing the risks and long-term consequences. The fate of CO\\(_2\\) in the subsurface is dictated by many processes including solute transport, multiphase compositional effects, and trapping mechanisms. The ability to properly capture these phenomena is limited by the abstraction of numerical models, the uncertainty in petrophysical characterization, and the modeling of the thermodynamic effects. In this work, we study the impact of each of these factors on the fate of CO\\(_2\\) injection in a meter-scale experimental setup. We model the evolution of the CO\\(_2\\) plume inside the tank using the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We then present an ensemble-based approach to quantify the uncertainties and study the predictability of the numerical models. The results emphasize the ability of the reservoir simulator to predict the evolution of CO\\(_2\\) in the FluidFlower experimental setup. They also highlight the importance of considering the uncertainty in experimental testing of petrophysical properties in the risk assessment of geological carbon storage projects.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe present investigation aims to evaluate the thermal conduction behavior of closed-cell porous media through micromechanical modeling. Numerical analyses were conducted using the finite element method. The overall thermal conductivity of the model structures, encompassing a range of porosity and pore geometry, was investigated. Attention is devoted to the effective response as a function of the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) porous microstructures. The model geometries were generated based on non-overlapping pore topologies arranged in an orderly manner so the unit-cell modeling approach can be used. The sensitivity of the results to pore morphology was examined by comparing the normalized effective thermal conductivities, and by comparing the numerical results with available analytical models. It was found that the effective thermal conductivity, decreasing with the increasing porosity, is insensitive to the spatial arrangement, clustering, and size distribution of closed pores. The numerical predictions match the classical Maxwell and Rayleigh equations in both 2D and 3D. Elliptical pores with mixed orientations lead to nominally isotropic behavior, but the effective conductivity is lower compared to circular pores. An analytical expression used to convert 2D results to 3D is validated numerically, with its general applicability assessed and the adjusting parameter quantified in this study.\n",

      "abstract AbstractReactive transport modeling in unique chamosite, illite, and kaolinite monomineralic clay reservoirs was performed to predict spatial and mineralogical control on H2(aq) distribution and flow dynamics at simulated underground hydrogen storage pressure and temperature conditions in high permeability depleted oil reservoirs and lower permeability sandstones. Results are normalized against simulations performed in pure quartz for comparative purposes and to serve as a benchmark for H2 storage in sandstone or quartz-arenite reservoirs. Isobaric and isothermal condition results indicate that Péclet numbers increase with volume rate of injected fluid. Advection-mediated transport is ubiquitous for injection rates between 0.01 and 1.0 L per second, although diffusion-mediated transport is prevalent in the center of the RMT block at 0.001 L per second injection. Source/sink term and Péclet number analysis indicate that the effect of mineralogy on H2(aq) transport is small. Flow velocities in kaolinite are typically the fastest, but chamosite Péclet numbers are greatest. This suggests that kaolinite favors diffusion, chamosite favors advection, and illite is intermediate. A more accurate reflection of underground hydrogen storage conditions incorporating temperature and pressure gradients, permeability anisotropy, and mineralogical heterogeneity shows a decrease in Péclet numbers proportional to distance from injection well. Thus, along the reservoir-caprock boundary and in the absence of cushion gas, H2(aq) loss through diffusion is probable. Although quantitative flow regime analysis cannot be determined at many grid point locations due to uniform H2(aq) concentration, these locations are very likely diffusion dominant.\n",

      "abstract AbstractCarbon paper is commonly used to fabricate electrodes for batteries, and its morphology is crucial to the internal mass transport. In this work, geometric models of carbon paper are obtained by experimental and numerical reconstruction methods. The micromorphology of the carbon paper is obtained with a scanning electron microscope and an X-ray computed tomography scanner, and the binary slicing method is used in the experimental reconstruction method. Three different methods are used for numerical reconstruction, namely the layered 2D fibre, 3D fibre stacking and layered 3D fibre stacking methods. The structure and characteristic parameters of the carbon paper, such as pore size distribution, dimensionless specific surface area, effective diffusion coefficient and anisotropic coefficient, are statistically analysed for comparison. The dimensionless effective diffusion coefficients of Li+ in different directions in the electrolyte-filled carbon paper are obtained using lattice Boltzmann method. Results show that the internal structural features directly affect mass transport. The curves of the calculated effective diffusivity versus porosity are well fitted using a power function similar to Bruggeman equation within the porosity range of 0.66–0.86. The anisotropic coefficient is obtained from the effective diffusion coefficient in different directions.\n",

      "abstract AbstractA numerical study of the pore structure in particle beds with anisotropic geometries was conducted. Pore network modeling (PNM) analysis was applied to spherical particle beds and thin disc-shaped particle (platelet) beds, separately. The pore size and connectivity were quantified by pore network extraction based on the watershed segmentation method. In the spherical particle bed, an isotropic pore network was formed and the local pore size depended on the particle density conditions. For the platelet bed, the pore structure depended on the macroscopic structure of the particles (clustered structure or nematic structure). In the platelet bed with a clustered structure, large pores were observed locally in the gaps between the clusters even at large densities. The pore network exhibited significant anisotropy in the nematic structure. The results of the pore network analysis were employed to calculate the pore tortuosity in the platelet bed, which is directly related to transport phenomena such as diffusivity. The obtained tortuosity was compared with the results of previous geometric models and the experimental results of diffusion coefficient in clay layers, showing good agreement. These results suggest that the pore structure of the anisotropic-shaped particle bed is complicated depending on the macroscopic structure of the particles.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPore network modeling (PNM) allows for a major reduction in computational cost when performing pore-scale flow simulations in porous media. Despite the increasing use of such a modeling approach, the studies tackling the simulation of the flow of non-Newtonian fluids are scarce and lack experimental validation. This represents a stumbling block due to nascent state of this field. Moreover, the choice of pore and throat shapes is often arbitrary and its effects on the accuracy of the numerical simulations have not been systematically evaluated. Previous research showed that shear-thinning fluids are deeply sensitive to the morphology of flow channels. The present work deals with the modeling of the flow of Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids through packs of spherical beads, with the aim to develop a reliable procedure to predict such flows based on PNM. A set of PNM flow simulations were performed using different pore morphologies, and the results were compared to previous experimental data. The effects of the rheological parameters and the size of the spheres were extensively evaluated. In this manner, the most suitable shape and geometry was identified and the differences between the results for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids analyzed. Furthermore, the permeability value computed by PNM and direct numerical simulations was compared to ensure the representativeness of the extracted networks. The results showed that PNM provides accurate predictions of the flow of both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids provided that the appropriate pore shape is used.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Geometric straining of particles in porous media is of critical importance in a broad range of natural and industrial settings, such as contaminant transport in aquifers and the permeability decline due to pore plugging in oil reservoirs. Pore network modeling is a computationally efficient approach to simulate transport problems in porous media that has been used to simulate particle deposition and size exclusion. However, existing network models are unable to simulate particle jamming due to the simplification of geometry and the lack of capability for simulating particle–particle interactions. Here, we develop a novel pore network model for particle jamming in porous media. The jamming in pore throats is predicted by the probability of jamming, which is a function of pore/particle size ratio, particle concentration, and coefficient of friction (COF). A unified probability model is developed based on Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of particle jamming in porous media consisting of a single layer of spherical grains. The geometry is based on two packing extremes, those with grains arranged in a triangle and a square. The model is then implemented into the pore network model to predict jamming in porous media. This framework combines the efficiency of network modeling and the accuracy of direct simulations on particle jamming. We verify the model against CFD-DEM simulations. The results of network simulations show that the probability of jamming increases with COF. At low particle concentrations (C = 5%), the probability of jamming for large pore throats is small. There is a critical particle concentration (C = 9%) when the grain/particle size ratio is 10, above which jamming is self-reinforcing and the inlet face of the porous medium will be completely blocked (C = 11%). The effect of velocity on the probability of jamming is insignificant compared with the effects of particle concentration and pore/particle size ratio. Article Highlights We propose a novel pore network model for particle jamming based on the probability. The pore network model has a higher computational efficiency, compared with other numerical models, such as CFD-DEM model. The pore network model can accurately predict the permeability changes of porous media during the jamming process.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe employment of 2D models to investigate the properties of 3D flows in porous media is ubiquitous in the literature. The limitations of such approaches are often overlooked. Here, we assess to which extent 2D flows in porous media are suitable representations of 3D flows. To this purpose, we compare representative elementary volume (REV) scales obtained by 2D and 3D numerical simulations of flow in porous media. The stationarity of several quantities, namely porosity, permeability, mean and variance of velocity, is evaluated in terms of both classical and innovative statistics. The variance of velocity, strictly connected to the hydrodynamic dispersion, is included in the analysis in order to extend conclusions to transport phenomena. Pore scale flow is simulated by means of a Lattice Boltzmann model. The results from pore scale simulations point out that the 2D approach often leads to inconsistent results, due to the profound difference between 2D and 3D flows through porous media. We employ the error in the evaluation of REV as a quantitative measure for the reliability of a 2D approach. Moreover, we show that the acceptance threshold for a 2D representation to be valid strongly depends on which flow/transport quantity is sought.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe Stokes–Brinkman coupling has been employed to investigate the flow through porous media composed of packed spheres. By matching the slip velocity using the Navier-slip condition, optimal values of the effective viscosity in the continuous stress condition and of the stress jump coefficient in the stress jump condition could be accurately determined. The correlations between the slip length (which has been accurately determined in Part 1) and the effective viscosity as well as the stress jump coefficient have been specified. The accuracy of these two optimal parameters (i.e., the effective viscosity and stress jump coefficient) has been assessed by comparing the velocity profiles in both the fluid and porous regions obtained from the Stokes–Brinkman coupling, with those obtained from the corresponding direct simulations. It is observed that the stress jump condition with the optimal stress jump coefficient yields a superior prediction in the velocity field. The optimal effective viscosity decreases as the solid volume fraction increases, whereas the stress jump coefficient increases with the solid volume fraction. By selecting the optimal parameters, the Stokes–Brinkman coupling with both the continuous stress condition and stress jump condition is applied to solve two example flow problems: a stick–slip–stick flow and a pressure-driven flow in a rectangular channel. Both the stress conditions in the Stokes–Brinkman coupling exhibit good performances in reproducing the velocity fields within the entire domain.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Understanding the permeability distribution is an important basis for the design of hydraulic strengthened gas extraction. However, the existing methods can not directly determine the nonuniform coal seam permeability after hydraulic flushing. The numerical simulation is commonly used to analyze permeability distribution, but the geostress and coal mechanical parameters are necessary for the previous simulation method, which are difficult to accurately obtain. To grasp the coal seam permeability improvement in hydraulic flushing engineering, the equivalent permeability and radius (EPR) method was proposed. In the EPR method, the equivalent permeability and equivalent permeability-enhancement radius, which are determined by field measurement and by simulation of gas migration models respectively, are used to simplify and equivalently express the coal seam permeability distribution after hydraulic flushing. The coal stress and mechanical parameters are not needed in the EPR method. The permeability and gas migration models of coal seam after the hydraulic flushing engineering were established and solved in the finite element software to verify the reliability of the EPR method. The gas flow rate, gas extraction amount, and gas pressure were compared between equivalent permeability and nonuniform permeability coal seams. Results show that the gas drainage effects of coal seams under the two permeability expressions are consistent, which demonstrates that the EPR method is accurate enough to value the permeability-improvement effect. This paper aims to propose a new method for field application to quantitatively evaluate the coal seam permeability improvement around an enlarged borehole, which is of great importance for hydraulic flushing enhanced-gas extraction engineering. Article Highlights The coal seam permeability evolution model and gas migration model were established. The equivalent permeability and equivalent radius are proposed to characterize the permeability distribution. The EPR method for quantitative assessment of the permeability improvement around an enlarged borehole was proposed.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe viscosity exhibited by shear-thinning fluids within the interstices of a porous medium differs depending on pore dimensions and injection velocity. Therefore, predicting the macroscopic value of viscosity required as input to Darcy’s law is challenging and needs accurate identification of the characteristic microscopic dimensions dominating global pressure losses. The most common approach consists of defining an apparent “in situ” shear rate which can be used in the bulk constitutive equation of the fluid to predict viscosity during flow through the porous medium.\n",
      " The dependence of this apparent shear rate on Darcy velocity has traditionally been assumed to be linear, which is appropriate in the case of Newtonian fluids and power-law fluids. However, yield stress and plateau viscosities that can potentially affect such dependence are not captured by power-law model, so the linear assumption may lead to inaccurate viscosity predictions. For this reason, a set of two-dimensional (2D) flow problems were considered and solved numerically to assess the effects of the shear rheology model, the pore size distribution and the microstructural complexity on the value of the apparent shear rate. In order to facilitate the analysis, the microscopic features of all the investigated porous media were well characterized through pore network modelling. The present results prove the inability of traditional approaches to predict the macroscopic viscous pressure losses generated during the creeping flow of widely used Herschel–Bulkley and Carreau fluids. In particular, the existence of a yield stress or a plateau viscosity induces significant deviations from linearity in the relationship between apparent shear rate and Darcy velocity. The importance of these deviations is, in turn, shown to be highly affected by the dispersion of the pore size distribution and the degree of shear thinning. Moreover, the reasons for such observations are discussed using an analytical approach.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe modeling of flow and heat transfer in porous media systems has always been a challenge, and the extended Darcy transport models are used for macro-level analysis. However, these models are subjected to the limitations depending upon the porous geometry such as pore size, pore type, effective porosity, tortuosity, permeability, and the flow characteristics. The forced convective flow of an incompressible viscous fluid through a channel filled with four different types of porous geometries constructed using the Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (or TPMS) model is presented in this study. Four TPMS lattice shapes, namely Diamond, I-WP, Primitive, and Gyroid, are created with same volume fraction of solid subdomain as 0.68 (or void fraction as 0.32). Using different configurations for the solid subdomain by treating it as (a) solid, (b) fluid, and (c) porous zone, three different classes of porous structures are further generated for each TPMS lattice. The present study is executed with the objective to investigate the effect of shape–morphology, tortuosity, microporosity, and effective porosity on permeability and inertial drag factor. A pore-scale direct numerical simulation approach is performed for the first two types of porous media by solving the Navier–Stokes equations. The specific microporosity is quantitatively induced in the solid subdomain where Darcy–Forchheimer equation is solved, whereas the Navier–Stokes equations are solved for the void subdomain in the third type of porous media. The results reveal that Darcy flow regime exists up to the mean velocity value of U < 0.0025 m/s (Re < 10) for all the cases discussed here, and it deviates at the higher mean velocity. The conductance to the flow shown by Darcy number has the maximum and minimum values for the Primitive Type 2 and I-WP Type 1 cases. The inertial drag coefficient is minimum in Diamond lattice and maximum in Primitive lattice at lower porosity (0.32), while Primitive lattice has minimum and I-WP lattice has maximum value of inertial drag coefficient for higher porosity (~ 1).\n",

      "abstract Abstract In this research, the lattice Boltzmann method was used to simulate the fluid flow in the random elliptical porous media. Since the tortuosity is one of the most important parameters of porous media and also, the hydraulic tortuosity is more accurate and more realistic than geometric tortuosity, therefore, the hydraulic tortuosity was discussed thoroughly in this study. Contrary to many studies in which the velocity-based method has been used for calculation of tortuosity, one of the novelties in this paper is the application of streamline-based tortuosity including the detailed description of mathematical method for calculation of streamline-based tortuosity and also, the calculation of it numerically and the comparison with velocity-based tortuosity at different porosities and at various aspect ratios. Furthermore, the deviation percentage of velocity-based tortuosity from streamline-based tortuosity was surveyed and depicted. Also, the behavior of streamline-based tortuosity was illustrated as a function of porosity at different aspect ratios and the results were compared with Comiti–Renaud equation and a new equation was proposed. With the structure factor defined as the ratio of porosity to tortuosity, the variation of this quantity with respect to porosity was displayed at different aspect ratios. Also, the formation factor variation versus porosity was discussed at different aspect ratios, too. Finally, the influence of obstacles shape on the tortuosity by varying aspect ratio was investigated and it was concluded that the orientation of elliptical obstacles (vertically or horizontally) has severe effect on the tortuosity.

      "abstract AbstractTraditionally, steady-state relative permeability is calculated from measurements on small rock samples using Darcy’s law and assuming a homogenous saturation profile and constant capillary pressure. However, these assumptions are rarely correct as local inhomogeneities exist; furthermore, the wetting phase tends to be retained at the outlet–the so-called capillary end effect. We have introduced a new method that corrects the relative permeabilities, analytically, for an inhomogeneous saturation profile along the flow direction. The only data required are the measured pressure drops for different fractional flow values, an estimate of capillary pressure, and the saturation profiles. An optimization routine is applied to find the range of relative permeability values consistent with the uncertainty in the measured pressure. Assuming a homogenous saturation profile systematically underestimates the relative permeability and this effect is most marked for media where one of the phases is strongly wetting with a noticeable capillary end effect. Relative permeabilities from seven two-phase flow experiments in centimetre-scale samples with different wettability were corrected while reconciling some hitherto apparently contradictory results. We reproduce relative permeabilities of water-wet Bentheimer sandstone that are closer to other measurements in the literature on larger samples than the original analysis. Furthermore, we find that the water relative permeability during waterflooding a carbonate sample with a wide range of pore sizes can be high, due to good connectivity through the microporosity. For mixed-wet media with lower capillary pressure and less variable saturation profiles, the corrections are less significant.\n",

      "abstract AbstractUnconventional resources, such as shale and tight-gas sandstone reservoirs, have been one of the key components of energy supplies in North America. Although research on tight and ultra-tight rocks has made significant progress, there exist questions about their physical and hydraulic properties that remain unanswered. For instance, the distribution of pore throats and its mathematical form in unconventional reservoir rocks are still unknown. The main objective of this study, therefore, is to investigate the potential probability density function representing the pore-throat size distribution in tight gas sandstones. For this purpose, we analyzed more than 100 Mesaverde tight gas sandstone samples collected from Western US basins under ambient and confining pressure conditions. We converted the measured capillary pressure (Sw-Pc) curves into the pore-throat size distributions by plotting \\(\\Delta\\) Sw/\\(\\Delta\\) ln(Pc) versus log-transform pore-throat diameter, log(d), and observed non-Gaussian trends for most samples. More specifically, we detected a heavily tailed (left-skewed) distribution, in contrast to mostly observed trends in conventional reservoir rocks. For the first time, we applied the generalized normal probability density function to characterize the log-transformed pore-throat size distributions and demonstrated that its unimodal and/or bimodal forms fit the distributions from tight gas sandstones reasonably well. For the ambient samples, the generalized normal distribution was the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) preferred model in 56% of cases, followed by the bimodal generalized normal (28%), bimodal normal (12%), and normal (4.2%) distributions. For the confined samples, the generalized normal distribution was the AICc preferred model in 46% of cases, followed by the bimodal generalized normal (32%), bimodal normal (18%), and normal (3.8%) distributions. For both unimodal and bimodal samples, we found that the median of the pore-throat size distribution was correlated to the logarithm of porosity (with \\(R>0.63)\\) and to the logarithm of permeability (with \\(R>\\) 0.74) for which the correlations were stronger. Results also showed that the (log)permeability was exponentially correlated to the porosity with R2 = 0.83 for the samples under the ambient conditions and R2 = 0.82 for the samples under the confined conditions.\n",

Through upscaling using formal homogenization, the local pore geometry can be accounted for to derive effective heat conductivities to be used at the Darcy scale. We here consider thin porous media, where not only the local pore geometry plays a role for determining the effective heat conductivity, but also the boundary conditions applied at the top and the bottom of the porous medium. Assuming scale separation and using two-scale asymptotic expansions, we derive cell problems determining the effective heat conductivity, which incorporates also the effect of the boundary conditions. Through solving the cell problems, we show how the local grain shape, and in particular its surface area at the top and bottom boundary, affects the effective heat conductivity through the thin porous medium.\n",

      "abstract AbstractIn order to assess the capability of a filter skeleton to retain flowing particles transported from eroded soil, different models based on continuous or discrete medium are available. The porous medium is often described by the grain size distribution, whereas constriction size distribution (CSD) is the key parameter governing the filtration process. This study describes the filter constrictions analysis and its application to the reduction after filtration. This investigation involves combined hole erosion-filtration experiments describing internal erosion of a base soil and particles filtration by a granular medium. The combination of experimental data of measured porosity and analytical results of the CSD was used to evaluate constrictions size reduction subsequently to filtration mechanism. The filtration depth was estimated according to retained particle mass and porosity reduction, which is evaluated from the evolution of hydraulic conductivity. The analysis of obtained results showed the occurrence of a non-uniform constriction reduction, suggesting an effective filtration depth.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe permeability of complex porous materials is of interest to many engineering disciplines. This quantity can be obtained via direct flow simulation, which provides the most accurate results, but is very computationally expensive. In particular, the simulation convergence time scales poorly as the simulation domains become less porous or more heterogeneous. Semi-analytical models that rely on averaged structural properties (i.e., porosity and tortuosity) have been proposed, but these features only partly summarize the domain, resulting in limited applicability. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning approaches have shown great promise for building more general models by virtue of accounting for the spatial arrangement of the domains’ solid boundaries. However, prior approaches building on the convolutional neural network (ConvNet) literature concerning 2D image recognition problems do not scale well to the large 3D domains required to obtain a representative elementary volume (REV). As such, most prior work focused on homogeneous samples, where a small REV entails that the global nature of fluid flow could be mostly neglected, and accordingly, the memory bottleneck of addressing 3D domains with ConvNets was side-stepped. Therefore, important geometries such as fractures and vuggy domains could not be modeled properly. In this work, we address this limitation with a general multiscale deep learning model that is able to learn from porous media simulation data. By using a coupled set of neural networks that view the domain on different scales, we enable the evaluation of large (\\(>512^3\\)) images in approximately one second on a single graphics processing unit. This model architecture opens up the possibility of modeling domain sizes that would not be feasible using traditional direct simulation tools on a desktop computer. We validate our method with a laminar fluid flow case using vuggy samples and fractures. As a result of viewing the entire domain at once, our model is able to perform accurate prediction on domains exhibiting a large degree of heterogeneity. We expect the methodology to be applicable to many other transport problems where complex geometries play a central role.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWith a view towards modelling the foam improved oil recovery process, fractional flow theory is used to study the dynamics of a foam as it propagates in a porous medium that is initially filled with liquid. In particular, a case is studied whereby, at a certain time, the net pressure driving the foam is decreased below the hydrostatic pressure at depth, leading to a local change in the flow direction. This is known as flow reversal. In both forward and reverse flow, the boundary between foamed gas and liquid is found as a discontinuous jump in liquid saturation. Over a certain thickness in the neighbourhood of this discontinuity, foam is finely textured, and the mobility of foamed gas drops by orders of magnitude relative to either pure gas or pure liquid. In reverse flow, however, the foam mobility itself and also the thickness over which low mobilities apply might differ from the forward flow case. Fractional flow theory reveals that the thickness of the low mobility region, and hence the resistance to motion that it presents, increases directly proportional to the distance travelled. Previous studies recognised this, but assumed the thickness of this region to be just a small fraction of the distance travelled by the discontinuity. Here, however, we demonstrate that the extent of the low mobility region, in both forward and reverse flow, accounts for a considerable fraction of the distance travelled by the foam, despite what was assumed in previous works.\n",

      "abstract AbstractModified or low-salinity waterflooding of carbonate oil reservoirs is of considerable economic interest because of potentially inexpensive incremental oil production. The injected modified brine changes the surface chemistry of the carbonate rock and crude oil interfaces and detaches some of adhered crude oil. Composition design of brine modified to enhance oil recovery is determined by labor-intensive trial-and-error laboratory corefloods. Unfortunately, limestone, which predominantly consists of aqueous-reactive calcium carbonate, alters injected brine composition by mineral dissolution/precipitation. Accordingly, the rock reactivity hinders rational design of brines tailored to improve oil recovery. Previously, we presented a theoretical analysis of 1D, single-phase brine injection into calcium carbonate-rock that accounts for mineral dissolution, ion exchange, and dispersion (Yutkin et al. in SPE J 23(01):084–101, 2018. https://doi.org/10.2118/182829-PA). Here, we present the results of single-phase waterflood-brine experiments that verify the theoretical framework. We show that concentration histories eluted from Indiana limestone cores possess features characteristic of fast calcium carbonate dissolution, 2:1 ion exchange, and high dispersion. The injected brine reaches chemical equilibrium inside the porous rock even at injection rates higher than 3.5 \\(\\times\\) 10\\(^{-3}\\) m s\\(^{-1}\\) (1000 ft/day). Ion exchange results in salinity waves observed experimentally, while high dispersion is responsible for long concentration history tails. Using the verified theoretical framework, we briefly explore how these processes modify aqueous-phase composition during the injection of designer brines into a calcium-carbonate reservoir. Because of high salinity of the initial and injected brines, ion exchange affects injected concentrations only in high surface area carbonates/limestones, such as chalks. Calcium-carbonate dissolution only affects aqueous solution pH. The rock surface composition is affected by all processes.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFluid flow through layered materials with different wetting behavior is observed in a wide range of applications in biological, environmental and technical systems. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the occuring transport mechanisms of the fluids at the interface between the layered constituents. Of special interest is the water transport in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Here, it is necessary to understand the transport mechanisms of water throughout the cell constituents especially on the cathode side, where the excess water has to be removed. This is crucial to choose optimal operating conditions and improve the overall cell performance. Pore-scale modeling of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and gas distributor has been established as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes. Investigating the interface between the hydrophobic porous GDL and the hydrophilic gas distributor, a particular challenge is the combination and interaction of the different material structures and wetting properties at the interface and its influence on the flow. In this paper, a modeling approach is presented which captures the influence of a hydrophilic domain on the flow in a hydrophobic porous domain at the interface between the two domains. A pore-network model is used as the basis of the developed concept which is extended to allow the modeling of mixed-wet interactions at the interface. The functionality of the model is demonstrated using basic example configurations with one and several interface pores and it is applied to a realistic GDL representation in contact with a channel-land structured gas distributor.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe investigate two-phase flow in porous media and derive a two-scale model, which incorporates pore-scale phase distribution and surface tension into the effective behavior at the larger Darcy scale. The free-boundary problem at the pore scale is modeled using a diffuse interface approach in the form of a coupled Allen–Cahn Navier–Stokes system with an additional momentum flux due to surface tension forces. Using periodic homogenization and formal asymptotic expansions, a two-scale model with cell problems for phase evolution and velocity contributions is derived. We investigate the computed effective parameters and their relation to the saturation for different fluid distributions, in comparison to commonly used relative permeability saturation curves. The two-scale model yields non-monotone relations for relative permeability and saturation. The strong dependence on local fluid distribution and effects captured by the cell problems highlights the importance of incorporating pore-scale information into the macro-scale equations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractModeling solute transport in heterogeneous porous media faces two challenges: scale dependence of dispersion and reproducing mixing separately from spreading. Both are crucial since real applications may require km scales whereas reactions, often controlled by mixing, may occur at the pore scale. Methods have been developed in response to these challenges, but none has satisfactorily characterized both processes. In this paper, we propose a formulation based on the Water Mixing Approach extended to account for velocity variability. Velocity is taken as an independent variable, so that concentration depends on time, space and velocity. Therefore, we term the formulation the Multi-Advective Water Mixing Approach. A new mixing term between velocity classes emerges in this formulation. We test it on Poiseuille’s stratified flow using the Water Parcel method. Results show high accuracy of the formulation in both dispersion and mixing. Moreover, the mixing process exhibits Markovianity in space even though it is modeled in time.\n",

      "abstract Abstract Reservoir modeling consists of two key components: the reproduction of the historical performance and the prediction of the future reservoir performance. Industry-standard reservoir simulators must run fast on enormous and possibly unstructured grids while yet guaranteeing a reasonable representation of physical and chemical processes. However, computational demands limit simulators in capturing involved physical and geochemical mechanisms, especially when chemical reactions interfere with reservoir flow. This paper presents a mathematical workflow, implemented in IORSim, that makes it possible to add geochemical calculations to porous media flow simulators without access to the source code of the original host simulator. An industry-standard reservoir simulator calculates velocity fields of the fluid phases (e.g., water, oil, and gas), while IORSim calculates the transport and reaction of geochemical components. Depending on the simulation mode, the geochemical solver estimates updated relative and/or capillary pressure curves to modify the global fluid flow. As one of the key innovations of the coupling mechanism, IORSim uses a sorting algorithm to permute the grid cells along flow directions. Instead of solving an over-dimensionalized global matrix calling a Newton–Raphson solver, the geochemical software tool treats the species balance as a set of local nonlinear problems. Moreover, IORSim applies basis swapping and splay tree techniques to accelerate geochemical computations in complex full-field reservoir models. The presented work introduces the mathematical IORSim concept, verifies the chemical species advection, and demonstrates the IORSim computation efficiency. After validating the geochemical solver against reference software, IORSim is used to investigate the impact of seawater injection on the NCS Ekofisk reservoir chemistry. Article Highlights The IORSim sorting algorithm decouples the nonlinear geochemical reaction calculations into recurring one-dimensional problems to assure numerical stability and computation efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the mathematical concept, implementation, and application of topological sorting for the first time on (industry) field-scale problems. IORSim combines topological sorting with basis swapping and splay trees to significantly reduce computation times. Moreover, a high-speed forward simulation mode was developed to allow the post-advection of chemical components to visualize species distribution, water chemistry, and mineral interactions. If the geochemical reactions interfere with the fluid flow, the IORSim backward mode uses relative permeability curves to update the global fluid flow at each time step. We validate the implemented topological scheme on a reservoir grid, show the computation efficiency, and compare the impact of explicit, implicit, and grid refinement on numerical dispersion. The decoupled flow simulator and geochemical reaction calculations allow seamless integration of full-field reservoir models that contain complex geological structures, a large number of wells, and long production histories. The computation capabilities of IORSim are demonstrated by simulating and reproducing the impact of seawater injection in the southern segment of the giant Ekofisk field (more than 50 years of injection and production history). IORSim shows that seawater injection changed the Ekofisk mineralogy and impacted the produced water chemistry. In the investigated Ekofisk case, seawater promoted calcite dissolution and led to the precipitation of magnesite and anhydrite. Moreover, surface complexation modeling revealed that sulfate is adsorbed on the calcite surface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWavelets are localized small waves that exhibit the characteristic oscillatory behavior of waves with an amplitude that declines rapidly to zero. Their properties include orthogonality or bi-orthogonality, a natural multiresolution and, often, compact support. These properties can be used to repeatedly rescale a signal or a function, decomposing it to a desirable level, and obtaining and preserving trend and detail data at all scales that allow re-composition of the original signal. The overall goal of this work is to create a set of wavelet-based (WB) numerical methods using different wavelet bases for application to the solution of the PDEs of interest to petroleum engineering, namely the solution of the PDEs of fluid flow through porous and fractured media. A particular emphasis of the study is in processes associated with ultra-low permeability media such as shale oil and shale gas reservoirs. To address the problem, we developed WTFS (wavelet transform flow simulator), a new flow simulator written in MATLAB that couples wavelet transform with a standard finite-difference scheme. In the current state of development, the WB numerical solution is verified against analytical solutions of 1D problems for liquid flow through porous media and is validated through comparisons to numerical solutions for problems of 2D and 3D flow through porous media obtained from a conventional numerical simulator.\n",

      "abstract AbstractPorous media characterization is crucial to engineering projects where the pore shape has impact on performance gains. Membrane filters, sportswear fabrics, and tertiary oil recovery are a few examples. Kozeny–Carman (K–C) models are one of the most frequently used to understand, for instance, the relation between porosity, permeability, and other small-scale parameters. However, they have limitations, such as the inability to capture the correct dependence of permeability on porosity, the imperfect handling of the linear and nonlinear effects yielded by its fundamental quantities, and the insufficiency of geometrical parameters to predict the permeability correctly. In this paper, we cope with the problem of determining shape factors for generic geometries that represent sundry porous media configurations. Specifically, we propose a method that embeds the Poiseuille number into the classical K–C equation and returns a substitute shape factor term for its original counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, the existing formulations are unable to obtain shape factors for pores whose geometry is beyond the regular ones. We apply a Galerkin-based integral (GBI) method that determines shape factors for generic cross sections of pore channels. The approach is tested on straight capillaries with arbitrary cross sections subject to steady single-phase flow under the laminar regime. We show that shape factors for basic geometries known from experimental results are replicable exactly. Besides, we provide shape factors with precision up to 4 digits for a class of geometries of interest. As a way to demonstrate the applicability of the GBI approach, we report a case study that determines shape factors for 19 generic individual pore sections of a laboratory experiment involving flow rate measurements in an industrial arrangement of a water-agar packed bed. Porosity, flow behavior, and velocity distributions determined numerically achieve a narrow agreement with experimental values. The findings of this study provide parameters that can help to design new devices or mechanisms that depend on arbitrary pore shapes, as well as to characterize fluid flows in heterogeneous porous media.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMany subsurface formations, such as soils, carbonate rocks, and mudstones, possess multiscale pore structures that impose significant challenges to the pore-scale modeling of flow and transport processes. Despite the development of several models, there is a lack of comparative studies and quantitative analysis to evaluate their performance. In this work, we present two image-based hybrid models for predicting absolute permeability and electrical formation factor: a dual-pore-network model (DPNM) and a pore-network-continuum model (PNCM). We use several publicly available digital rock samples of Estaillades carbonate, one of which includes experimentally characterized sub-resolution regions (i.e., microporosity) represented by 3D maps of porosity and entry pressure. We perform comprehensive comparisons between the DPNM and PNCM, focusing on the strengths and limitations of the DPNM. Our results show that, assuming homogeneous microporosity, both the DPNM and PNCM accurately predict absolute permeability and formation factors. However, for realistic heterogeneous microporosity, the DPNM significantly underestimates absolute permeability by more than an order of magnitude, compared to the PNCM. We also explore two methods to improve the performance of our DPNM. Our findings will provide a foundation for the application of DPNMs to a wide range of geological and engineering systems.\n",

      "abstract AbstractMuch of the continental margins in the world oceans provide the necessary thermodynamic conditions to store CO\\(_2\\) as ice-like hydrates (CO\\(_2\\cdot\\)6 H\\(_2\\)O). While resistant to buoyant migration and leakage, the fundamental growth mechanisms that control the injection, capacity, and security of CO\\(_2\\) hydrates stored in the seafloor remain unresolved. Extensive field and laboratory testing give rise to conflicting views on the kinetics and growth configurations of hydrates, where mechanistic models reconciling the formation of hydrates observed in nature remain missing. This work elucidates a fundamental pore-scale reactive transport mechanism that underpins the rate and morphology of hydrate formation. We reveal a previously unrecognized mode of hydrate formation in porous seafloor sediments, hydrate film growth via reaction-imbibition, where superhydrophilic hydrate crystallites (\\(\\theta \\sim 0^\\circ\\)) formed at water–CO\\(_2\\) interfaces create a secondary microporous medium (\\(\\sim\\) 10 to 100 nm pores) within lithologic sediment pores (\\(\\sim\\) 10 to 100 \\(\\mu\\)m pores) to promote further hydrate growth. Unlike past diffusion-controlled models, we show that spontaneous water imbibition into the hydrate micropores establishes rapidly new water–CO\\(_2\\) interfaces (i.e., hydrate formation surfaces) via capillary-driven convection and is the dominant mechanism for supplying water to the hydrate formation interface.\n",

      "abstract AbstractProper characterization of the mechanical and flow properties of participating rock formations is crucial for subsurface geo-energy projects, including hydrocarbon extraction, geologic carbon storage, and enhanced geothermal systems. Application of mechanical and hydraulic pressures changes the porosity of rock and modifies flow paths. For low-permeable or “tight” rock that mainly contains nanoscale pores and serves as the confining layer for underground storage operations, a significant change in permeability may occur due to a small change in porosity. The pore volume changes in nanoporous geomaterials are extremely difficult to measure directly, but can be assessed from the knowledge of the hydro-mechanical response. Experimental methods to measure the stress-dependent permeability and poroelastic parameters of fluid-saturated tight rock are introduced. Eau Claire shale, Opalinus clay (claystone), and Charcoal granite are selected as representative materials for tight rock and their pore structure and material properties are carefully investigated. The porosity–permeability relationship for tight rock is established by adopting a power-law dependence with the exponent value in the range of 15–17, thus being significantly larger than that for a porous reservoir rock. Consequently, even small perturbations of porosity can cause orders of magnitude changes in permeability possessing a risk on the sealing capacity of the tight formations.\n",

      "abstract AbstractFormulation of an effective stress equation for unsaturated soils where all relevant physical characteristics are included has challenged researchers for several decades. On one hand, the interfacial forces and the contractile skin have recently been understood to be of significant contribution to the effective stress, particularly at low degrees of saturation. On the other hand, the microstructural effects play a significant role, especially in fine-grained soils. In this study, an equation is proposed for the effective stress parameter (\\(\\chi\\)) based on the recent advances in modeling the adsorbed water, and thereby determining the capillary water retention curves. In the proposed relationship, both the microstructural effect and interfacial forces are taken into account. Additionally, in formulating effective stress, these two aforementioned aspects have been considered and formulated for both drying and wetting conditions. To this end, the interfacial forces were determined based on the capillary water content. Next, the proposed model was further simplified to reduce the number of unknown parameters to one with the rest of the parameters readily available from the soil water retention curve. The simplified formulation agrees fairly well when compared with the experimental data on soils experiencing both drying and wetting paths. Furthermore, assessing the performance of the proposed model, compared with the available equations incorporating the contribution of the interfacial forces, indicates the superiority of the proposed model for the eight soil types examined in this study.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWith hydraulic fracturing technology, manmade fractures can be generated around the shale-gas wells. After hydraulic fracturing at each fracture stage, many wells in shale reservoirs have the “shut-in” process, which provides many precious data for parameter estimation. But, owing to intricate geological and engineering factors, the fractures in reservoirs are asymmetric and heterogeneous, which brings a great challenge for fracture estimation. To improve this situation, coupling with deep learning (DL) approach and experimental practices, we established a surrogate model for non-uniform fractures at one fracture stage, based on deep Bi-directional LSTM model. First, a well testing model containing three distinct flow regions is developed, namely (1) heterogeneous hydraulic fractures, (2) the inner region affected by hydraulic fracturing, and (3) the outer region without stimulation. Laplace transformation methods are used for model solutions. Then, with the model solutions, a surrogate model based on deep bidirectional LSTM is built for improving computational efficiency. Compared with the proxy model based on LSTM, RNN and ANN, Bi-LSTM model can effectively reduce the early prediction error of pressure derivative, and the average relative prediction error is 1.16%. The pressure transient behavior of the surrogate model can be divided into four flow regimes, which represent bilinear flow, interporosity flow, linear flow and boundary dominated flow, respectively. Finally, model verification was shown by comparing with the results from traditional well testing model. The results show that the calculation speed of the surrogate model is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the well test model. The findings of this study can help to efficiently evaluate the fracture parameter in complex fracture system generated by large-scale fracturing treatments in shale reservoirs.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe effects of periodicity assumptions on the macroscopic properties of packed porous beds are evaluated using a cascaded Lattice-Boltzmann method model. The porous bed is modelled as cubic and staggered packings of mono-radii circular obstructions where the bed porosity is varied by altering the circle radii. The results for the macroscopic properties are validated using previously published results. For unsteady flows, it is found that one unit cell is not enough to represent all structures of the fluid flow which substantially impacts the permeability and dispersive properties of the porous bed. In the steady region, a single unit cell is shown to accurately represent the fluid flow across all cases studied\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe linear stability analysis of Darcy–Brinkman–Bénard convection (DBBC) in a binary fluid-saturated porous layer is studied numerically using \\(n\\) term Galerkin approach for rigid–rigid, isothermal boundaries. The occupied binary fluid and porous medium are assumed to be in thermal non-equilibrium. Thus, two energy equations are used for each phase. The critical values of the Darcy–Rayleigh and wave numbers for the onset of convection are obtained by considering ten terms in the Galerkin solution. The effect of the five parameters of the model, namely the Darcy number, Da, the modified ratio of thermal conductivity \\(\\gamma\\), the Lewis number Le, the separation ratio coefficient, \\(\\chi\\), and the inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, H, on the stability of the system is discussed in detail and presented with the aid of plots and tables. The onset of convection in a binary fluid-saturated porous medium is delayed for realistic boundary conditions compared with ideal boundary conditions (stress-free, isothermal boundary conditions). Increasing the values of the Darcy number, inter-phase heat transfer coefficient, and the separation ratio coefficient stabilizes DBBC. In contrast, the thermal conductivity ratio and Lewis number are destabilize the system. Furthermore, convective cell size remains unaltered with increasing \\(\\chi\\). Convection is delayed in the pure fluid medium compared to the binary fluid medium. Local thermal non-equilibrium ceases for small and large inter-phase heat transfer coefficient values.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe onset of thermal convection in two-dimensional porous cavities heated from below is studied theoretically. An open (constant-pressure) boundary is assumed, with zero perturbation temperature (thermally conducting). The resulting eigenvalue problem is a full fourth-order problem without degeneracies. Numerical results are presented for rectangular and elliptical cavities, with the circle as a special case. The analytical solution for an upright rectangle confirms the numerical results. Streamlines penetrating the open cavities are plotted, together with the isotherms for the associated closed thermal cells. Isobars forming pressure cells are depicted for the perturbation pressure. The critical Rayleigh number is calculated as a function of geometric parameters, including the tilt angle of the rectangle and ellipse. An improved physical scaling of the Darcy–Bénard problem is suggested. Its significance is indicated by the ratio of maximal vertical velocity to maximal temperature perturbation.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe adequate management of the damage caused by effective permeability loss in stress-sensitive reservoirs becomes essential to productivity maintenance. This paper proposes a new unsteady-state poroelastic solution for the nonlinear hydraulic diffusivity equation in Biot’s effective stress-sensitive reservoirs fully penetrated by fractured oil wells. The hydraulic fracture in the proposed mathematical modeling is finite with tip effects and crosses the whole reservoir net pay. The NHDE is expanded in a first-order asymptotic series, and a poroelastic integro-differential solution coupled with a Green’s function (GF) is used to represent the source/sink term. A set of pore pressure and permeability data is used from geomechanical literature and transformed into effective stress through Biot’s equation. The effect of the Biot’s coefficient, overburden stress, oil flow rate, fracture’s tip, and proppant porosity arrangements is simulated. The results show that these parameters are essential to minimize formation damage. The accuracy, ease of implementation, and low computational costs constitute the main advantages of the model addressed in this paper. Hence, it may be a valuable and attractive mathematical tool to identify flow regimes, providing permeability loss control and supporting well–reservoir management. Hence, the proposed modeling becomes a useful and attractive tool for forecasting and monitoring permeability loss, oil flow rate specification, and reservoir history matching.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe partial differential equations describing immiscible, but soluble, carbon dioxide (CO2) displacement of brine in saline storage formations are developed including mass transfer across the CO2–brine interface. Scaling relationships for characteristic time among laboratory and representative storage formation conditions are found upon assumption that free-phase CO2 transport during injection is dominated by pressure-driven flow. The implication is that an hour in the FluidFlower (room-scale visual model) scales to hundreds of years of elapsed time in the storage formation. The scaling criteria permit extrapolation of the effects of changes in parameters and operating conditions. Interphase mass transfer allows CO2 to saturate the brine phase and the finite time of such mass transfer results in substantial time to approach equilibrium. Significant mixing of CO2 dissolved into formation brine with original brine is found experimentally and is also predicted. The magnitude of onset time for buoyancy-driven fingers that enhance mixing of CO2 is typically only a fraction of the duration of CO2 injection and in general agreement with theoretical analysis in the literature. Predictions for onset time of convective mixing at representative storage formation conditions, likewise, teach that the onset time for fingering is significantly less than the duration of CO2 injection in some cases. The implications of this observation include that mixing of CO2 with brine and the subsequent settling due to gravity are relatively rapid and coincide with the period of active CO2 injection.\n",

      "abstract AbstractThe fundamental characteristic of a semi-permeable porous material is that the solvent is allowed to pass through it but the solute is not. Due to this characteristic, a solute concentration gradient can drive chemical osmosis flow in the solution-saturated semi-permeable porous material. Although analytical solutions have been derived for one-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems, computational simulations of two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems remain lacking to date. To fill this gap, a new mathematical model is first established, in this paper, for describing two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems in solution-saturated semi-permeable porous materials. Then a computational simulation procedure, which contains the finite difference and finite element methods, is proposed to solve the partial differential equations involved in the established mathematical model. For the purpose of verifying the proposed computational simulation procedure, the analytical solution of a benchmark problem has been derived mathematically. The related computational simulation results have demonstrated that: (1) the proposed computational simulation procedure is correct and accurate for solving chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems; and (2) the applied boundary conditions have significant effects on the computational simulation results of two-dimensional chemical osmosis induced flow and solute concentration variation problems in the solution-saturated semi-permeable porous material.\n",

      "abstract AbstractTo characterise the sorption behaviour of wood or other hygroscopic materials with the use of water vapour sorption experiments, an accurate understanding of water vapour transport both to and through the sample material is necessary. Within the last decades, various modelling approaches on the sorption kinetics were developed, but there seems to be no general agreement on the relevance of water vapour transport. Using small amounts of grained wood, this study aims to estimate the influence of water vapour transport in sorption experiments on small sample sizes. A theoretical analysis based on a diffusion equation including a simplified sink/source term was carried out and compared with corresponding experiments. Nonlinear isotherm and temperature were shown to have a major impact on the effective diffusion of water vapour, whereas step size in humidity seems to mainly influence processes within the cell wall (e.g. relaxation and reorganisation of microstructure). Considering the paths of stagnant air above sample surface, the anomalous behaviour for a variation in sample thickness of grained wood can be explained. In conclusion, water vapour transport appreciably influences the sorption kinetics of small sample sizes and has to be considered in the modelling and interpretation of water vapour sorption experiments.\n",

      "abstract AbstractWe study transport of passive tracers by plane laminar flows with stagnation points. This setup serves as a simple model of transport in porous media. Close to stagnation points, the flow velocity is much lower than on the average. Many experimental data disclose that transport through porous media is slower than predictions of the standard advection-diffusion model. Commonly, in descriptions of flows through porous media the heterogeneity of flow is disregarded, and some average velocity is adopted. To model regular arrays of flow patterns with stagnation points, we employ the construction of special flow: a combination of mapping and a sort of ceiling function with singularity. We show that, depending on the type of stagnation points, many experimentally established effects can be reproduced. This includes the linear sorption, usually described by the standard MIM model, as well as subdiffusion, described by the fractional MIM model. We also show that slow molecular diffusion does not eliminate the effects of the transport slowdown.\n",

The side walls of the cavity are heated and cooled by constant heat fluxes, while the horizontal walls are adiabatic. The governing parameters for the problem are thermal Rayleigh number, R, the aspect ratio of the cavity, A, and the variable permeability constant, c. On the basis of the Darcy–Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations, a new analytical solution is developed in the limit of a long shallow cavity. A numerical study of the same phenomenon, obtained by solving the complete system of governing equations, is conducted to assess the validity of the analytical results. It is demonstrated that, for a wide range of the governing parameters, the flow structure and the heat transfer were well predicted by the analytical solution.\n",

The incompressible fluid is Newtonian and the compressible fluid is an inviscid ideal gas. The surface tension associated with the interfaces between the two fluids introduces capillary forces that vary along the tube due to the variation in the tube radius. The interplay between effects due to the capillary forces and the compressibility results in a set of properties that are different from incompressible two-phase flow. As the fluids move towards the outlet, the bubbles of the compressible fluid grows in volume due to the decrease in pressure. The volumetric growth of the compressible bubbles makes the volumetric flow rate at the outlet higher than at the inlet. The growth is not only a function of the pressure drop across the tube, but also of the ambient pressure. Furthermore, the capillary forces create an effective threshold below which there is no flow. Above the threshold, the system shows a weak nonlinearity between the flow rates and the effective pressure drop, where the nonlinearity also depends on the absolute pressures across the tube.\n",

      "abstract AbstractConvolution neural networks (CNNs) are well-suited to model the nonlinear relationship between the microscale geometry of porous media and the corresponding flow distribution, thereby accurately and efficiently coupling the flow behavior at the micro- and macroscale levels. In this paper, we have identified the challenges involved in implementing CNNs for macroscale model closure in the turbulent flow regime, particularly in the prediction of the drag force components arising from the microscale level. We report that significant error is incurred in the crucial data preparation step when the Reynolds averaged pressure and velocity distributions are interpolated from unstructured stretched grids used for large eddy simulation (LES) to the structured uniform grids used by the CNN model. We show that the range of the microscale velocity values is 10 times larger than the range of the pressure values. This invalidates the use of the mean squared error loss function to train the CNN model for multivariate prediction. We have developed a CNN model framework that addresses these challenges by proposing a conservative interpolation method and a normalized mean squared error loss function. We simulated a model dataset to train the CNN for turbulent flow prediction in periodic porous media composed of cylindrical solid obstacles with square cross-section by varying the porosity in the range 0.3 to 0.88. We demonstrate that the resulting CNN model predicts the pressure and viscous drag forces with less than 10% mean absolute error when compared to LES while offering a speedup of O(106).\n",
